        "passage": "According to a recent report, the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be one of the most significant barriers to mass adoption. Volatility, the report cites, causes individuals to not trust cryptocurrency as a long-term means of storing value. However, most respondents to the report cited an interest in owning cryptocurrencies if they did not already. Further, those that already own it have generally used it for purchases in the past.  Volatility is an issue that often comes up when discussing cryptocurrency. But what does it mean, exactly? Simply put, volatility is when something has an unstable price. Something like milk or eggs will typically have a relatively stable price that does not change quickly in a short amount of time. Prices will instead change slowly over the course of years or decades, which means goods like these have low volatility. High volatility, on the other hand, is what could be hampering cryptocurrency adoption. That’s when prices can swing massively either up or down in a matter of hours. As for what causes volatility, that’s a debate that can easily extend far beyond the scope of this article. But the most essential element is that if something is new, and a comparatively small number of people are seeking it, prices can swing much faster depending on sentiment and fear. For example, if a legal ruling comes down that suggests cryptocurrencies could face a crackdown, prices will plummet immediately. On the other hand, if a major bank or company announces that they’ll be getting involved in cryptocurrency, prices could jump up in response depending on how significant the announcement was. The report suggests that a large number of individuals are highly concerned about volatility. Specifically, approximately 90% of respondents claimed to “worry about volatility”, and 60% described volatility as an inconvenience. More than half of respondents cited volatility as the key reason behind their choice to not get involved in cryptocurrency. These issues aside, the report also dug into a few other interesting questions relating to cryptocurrency. Specifically, the report asked how respondents felt about there being a single world currency in place. This was met with a largely positive response, with around two thirds of respondents feeling such a development would be “beneficial to society.” Respondents reported feelings suggesting that a global currency would make it much more difficult if not impossible for a single country to manipulate the financial system as a whole for its own gains, such as by printing out more money or manipulating interest rates. Others reported that a global currency would “level the economic playing field for all countries” and make it easier for those of smaller nations to participate in the worldwide economy. While these points are interesting to consider, it does beg an obvious question – what would the ideal global currency be? One easy answer is bitcoin. Bitcoin would make an ideal instrument just because it is un-leveraged (meaning it is not a debt based asset like the US dollar is) and it is not minted or manipulated by any single entity. There would be many issues that would need to be overcome first such as scaling issues, transaction fees, and so on. But given enough time and investment, these issues could undoubtedly be fixed. As for whether or not the world would benefit from having a single currency, that’s an entirely different debate. One popular trend recently in the cryptocurrency world is stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that do their best to implement a system where they will have as little volatility as possible. Some examples include USDT and MakerDAO. Both of which have seen reasonable amounts of success and have generally kept their goal of having a far more stable price than other digital assets. While stablecoins can be handy for high-frequency traders and other situations, a stablecoin as we know it today would be far from ideal for a global currency.  Read: What are Stablecoins? The reason for this is simple. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoins are created by groups or companies with the intent of making a profit. Not only that, but these groups also typically retain the ability to create and destroy units of their currency at will. In the case of USDT, Tether has been known to mint hundreds of millions of new units at a time based upon the claim that they have added an equal amount of US dollars to their reserves. However, Tether is, by their own admission, completely unable to be audited based on the way their business is designed. It goes without saying that these types of stable coins can in many cases be very easily manipulated by their creators. Further, the motivations behind the creators are clear. And that is to make a profit. A non-biased and completely decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin or something similar would be a far better solution. You may argue that bitcoin, due to its volatility issues, is far from a preferable global currency. This assumption is based on the suggestion that bitcoin prices will continue to be volatile even if the digital asset sees billions of users each day. The truth is, if bitcoin were to one day become a major global currency (whether it be the only one or not), it would become far less volatile over time as its demand or lack thereof would stabilize, and so would prices. So to sum up the volatility debate, the volatility we are seeing today is undoubtedly scaring off a lot of would-be bitcoin users. However, volatility also represents an opportunity for traders, and as adoption grows, lower volatility will undoubtedly come with it.",

        "passage": "In 2018, Litecoin (LTC) didn’t do all too hot. The cryptocurrency fell in this market’s standings, losing seats to competitors in Bitcoin Cash and EOS. But, as the asset’s block reward reduction has neared, LTC has been imbued with an increase in investment interest and adoption. Revealed earlier this week, an up-and-coming crypto payments startup has added Litecoin, making it the fifth digital asset available on its platform.  Read: What are Flexa & Spedn? Complete Guide According to a recent blog post, Litecoin has now been formally added to Flexa, a payments ecosystem that allows merchants to accept cryptocurrencies and receive U.S. dollars. The “OG” Bitcoin fork, created by former Google and Coinbase engineer Charlie Lee, joins Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and the Gemini Dollar — the four original assets that garnered support from Flexa on May 13th. Seemingly explaining why it was making this addition, Flexa writes in the release that LTC “distinguishes itself” from other blockchain platforms with low transaction fees (often under $0.01), fast confirmation times (2.5 minutes), high volumes, “and an active community of avid supporters and payments enthusiasts.” Indeed, Litecoin is known to have an impassioned community.  As of the time of press, Litecoin can now be used to purchase goods via Flexa in over 39,250 stores (and counting) across the United States. Retail and restaurant chains that accept Flexa-backed payments, which are routed primarily through Gemini, include Baskin Robbins, Bed Bath & Beyond, GameStop, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Petco, and Whole Foods — the last of which is arguably the most notable because the luxury grocery store is owned by Amazon. Speaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei on Wednesday, Lee told a crowd: Litecoin can now be spent, and thus converted to fiat, via Flexa’s SPEDN application, which is currently live on Apple’s iOS and in testing on Android. This comes shortly after the Litecoin Foundation, the organization behind much of the cryptocurrency’s development and adoption, joined hands with two crypto industry partners, Bibox Exchange and Ternio, to release a debit card that can be “loaded” with LTC, Bibox Token, and Ternio Token. This is arguably bigger news than Flexa, as it allows users to spend any of the aforementioned digital assets in any store that accepts Visa plastic. This comes as cryptocurrencies at large have begun to see their viability as a medium of exchange, both digitally and physically, swell. As reported by this outlet on a previous date, video game streaming service Twitch has begun to accept subscription payments via BitPay once again, giving viewers a chance to contribute to their favorite gamers with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Also, electronics distributor Avnet, privacy-centric browser Tor, and telecommunications giant AT&T recently added cryptocurrency payments. Prominent blockchain researcher Willy Woo claims that such cases of adoption should be a positive growth catalyst for Bitcoin:",

        "passage": "The Wall Street Journal published an article on August 5 going over the infamous and costly pump and dump groups and strategies that have been plaguing cryptocurrency for years. The Journal detected more than 105 individual groups operating through chat services like Telegram and Discord through their research. These groups have caused over $200 million worth of trade volumes through these actions. But what is the real cost of pump and dump schemes? Who are the victims, and how can you protect yourself from being victimized?  Before we dig in too deep, let’s go over the basics of what a pump and dump is. Pump and dump is a type of financial fraud that has existed since the early days of the stock market. Basically speaking, a group of people will work together to purchase a large amount of a stock or cryptocurrency that has a generally low number of outstanding shares, coins, or tokens. The scheme is also often known to target assets that have particularly low asset prices. Generally, the architect of the scheme will decide on an asset to target. That person will then simultaneously place a huge buy order for themselves to profit form, and announce the target in a Telegram or Discord group (for cryptocurrency pumps). The rest of the members of the group will be told to buy as much of the asset as possible once the target is announced and hold onto it until a so-called “target price” is achieved. Once the target price is achieved, group members are instructed to sell all of it at the newly inflated price. According to the Wall Street Journal piece, cryptocurrency pump and dump trades are the most profitable when completed during the first minute after the pump signal is released. Additionally, the pump and dump cycle often completes in a manner of minutes, though in some cases they can last for a few hours or even a few days if enough members of the public also buy in on the inflated price to keep it up. One recent example of a pump and dump is what happened to Bitcoin Diamond last month.  Two pumps occurred with about 2 days time in between. In each instance, prices more than doubled and then returned to their normal price in a similarly quick fashion. Some of you may be wondering, who is the victim of a pump and dump? Also, why is it even a crime in the first place? To understand this, we need to understand who the victims of these kind of schemes are. Generally speaking, there are two different types of victims, one innocent, and one kind of asking for it. The most basic kind of victim is a person who sees an asset suddenly jump up in price and thinks that they can grab on before the asset climbs any further and make a profit. For example, when Bitcoin Diamond increased in price by more than 50% in just a few minutes, someone watching charts could see this and think that Bitcoin Diamond was about to “moon” and so they wanted to get in on it before prices got too out of control. This person then buys the asset at the artificially inflated price, and then holds onto it expecting the price to continue moving upwards, which it very well may not do. If they don’t sell the asset quickly, however, they are likely to lose a significant portion of their invested value. Some pump and dumps can be so effective that they can cause an asset to increase in price by several multiples instead of just a few percentage points. If someone buys into the top, they will undoubtedly lose nearly all of their investment value. The Wall Street Journal included information about a second type of victim. In this case, the victim is someone who thought that they could take advantage of the pump and dump group by participating in it. While it may feel like you are getting involved in some secret maneuver, the truth is those that participate in pump groups are often nothing but pawns themselves. According to the WSJ article, one victim they interviewed said that these groups “[incentivize] the poor followers to keep buying until the [target] price is reached, which it often never does,” and that they “instantly lost $5,000 in about 30 seconds.” Pump and dumps still happen in regular stock markets, but they are incredibly rare. That’s because in order to buy and sell stock, you either need to be a registered broker, or have a registered brokerage account with verified ID information. This means that anyone who participates in or orchestrates a pump and dump can be easily caught and punished. Cryptocurrency pumps are no less illegal by most legal jurisdictions. However, cryptocurrencies are by their nature anonymous and exchanges typically do not require KYC registration with a few exceptions (like Coinbase and others that offer fiat pairs). This means that tracking down and punishing those that are behind the schemes is a lot more difficult, if not downright impossible. You may also be asking yourself, what’s the best way to protect myself against pump and dumps? The answer to that is twofold, and is fairly simple. First, obviously don’t join or participate in a pump group. They may call themselves a signals group or a trading information group, but they are all the same. Just remember that these groups are often looking for new members because they want additional money to be poured in so that those operating the scheme that have advanced knowledge can use you and effectively steal your money. While there is a chance that you could make a profit on the pump, your risk of loss is even higher, and of course you are almost undoubtedly breaking the law where you live. Second, if you see a small altcoin suddenly explode in price seemingly for no reason at all within an extremely short time window, you are almost certainly witnessing a pump in progress. The best thing for you to do is to simply ignore it and move on. If you’re particularly worried about pumps, then your best option could be to simply stick with large market cap assets like bitcoin and Ethereum, as these assets are significantly more difficult to manipulate (although nothing is completely immune to manipulation) simply because they are so much bigger. The amount of money necessary to cause a pump to occur is out of reach for everyone but the wealthiest of the wealthy in the world. And those people would be wise to not break the law simply because the richer you are, the closer you will be watched by your government.",

        "passage": "Infamous former BitConnect spokesperson Carlos Matos has resurfaced on the Internet. He was last seen just a few days ago doing a YouTube live stream about his attempts to gain “health and wealth” through a process of intermittent water fasting. Carlos Matos became famous when he appeared in a promotional video for the now defunct BitConnect. BitConnect, of course, was a incredibly popular scam that cost many people thousands or more dollars, and even some their entire life savings.  To summarize, the system worked by promising people that they could deposit Bitcoin and lend it out through some sort of automated process. The end result would be a consistent, reliable, and guaranteed returns with daily payouts. This, of course, all collapsed when the scheme fell apart. The system relied on its own cryptocurrency, BitConnectCoin or BCC, which has alleged lost its last exchange. For more detailed information on BitConnect, make sure to read our article on it here. In the original video, which was then later parodied on HBO’s Last Week Tonight, Carlos Matos begins with his catchphrase “hey hey hey” and “what’s a what’s a what’s up, BitConnect!”  Comedian Keegan-Michael Key doing a Carlos Matos impression This appearance then spawned a number of memes and remixes, with the most popular in general being when Matos screamed out “BitConnect” several times. This is often rendered ‘BITCONEEEEE’ or some other variation on the same theme. In many ways, Matos became the face of the collapse even though his involvement with it is still not fully known.  A popular Telegram sticker pack featuring Matos If the original presentation is to be believed, then Matos was supposed to be an every man investor who joined BitConnect and turned his $25,000 into five times that amount in just a few months. In the video, Matos also claimed his wife didn’t believe him and thought that BitConnect was a scam. Of course, all of this could have been fabricated. While a number of people tied to BitConnect such as Trevon James and Crypto Nick have been attracting attention from authorities, Matos so far appears to have escaped unscathed. A sharp-eyed Redditor caught Carlos Matos after he started posting new streams and videos to YouTube one month ago. These videos mostly start out with Matos performing his usual “hey hey hey” and “what’s up”, routine for which he is now famous. The majority of the live stream videos all follow a similar pattern. They start with the catchphrase, going to Carlos saying how he feels so wonderful and is so excited, and the videos are filled with some of the most atrocious shaky cam we’ve ever seen. It is guaranteed to make those sensitive to it feel nauseous in a matter of seconds.  So the big question is, what is he selling this time? Is it another crypto Ponzi scheme? In the last month Matos uploaded quite a few hours of content. We listen to a few of his videos in their entirety but were not able to find any mention of specific products, plans, companies, or endorsements. Instead, Matos continues to go on about his own personal weight loss attempts. Specifically, Matos has been engaging in a plan of intermittent fasting. In one video Matos says that for three days a week he will not eat anything for 20 hours of the day, and will only eat during four them. We’re not health at experts here at Blockonomi, but to the casual observer, this sounds like a really bad idea. So what is his goal in doing this? Our best guess is that he is trying to establish some credibility as a weight loss coach, or wants to attract a sponsor after establishing a social media presence. Given how widespread Matos-based memes are, and still are to this day, it was surprising to see that his videos so far garnered only a small amount of attention. Carlos did answer a few questions before to commenters. One commenter asked about Carlos’s accent and where he was born. To this he replied: Others have made jokes at Matos’ expense, such as I.K Art who said: And so while Carlos may be permanently branded as “the BitConnect guy”, he seems to be trying his best to move on and pursue other things. Hopefully he will stay away from cryptocurrency scams.",

        "passage": "Call it Open Finance. Call it DeFi. Call it whatever you’d like. In any case, a major trend in the Ethereum ecosystem lately is disintermediating complex financial operations to make it easier than ever for users to turn money services into a “do it yourself,” or DIY, activity. The latest developments in that vein this week come via Staked and the Universal Market Access (UMA) project, both of which have rolled out new services that are likely at the tip of the spear where DeFi innovations are concerned.  With regard to Staked, the company just announced its new Robo-Advisor for Yield (RAY) service, which is comprised of a series of smart contracts and is designed to automatically funnel a user’s investments into the highest yielding investment opportunities in Ethereum DeFi at any given time.  To use the service, a trader must deposit ether (ETH), DAI, or USD Coin (USDC) into the provided RAY contract and thereafter select what DeFi “opportunities should be considered.” The system then automatically moves around those funds to take advantages of the best yielding outlets at the time. The plan is for the service to eventually move beyond mere lending and into different cryptoeconomy activities like the coming Dai savings rate, the Staked team explained: Like its name suggests, the company supports Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain projects like Tezos, Cosmos, and Livepeer. The startup is backed by investors like Winklevoss Capital, the Digital and Coinbase Ventures. Also in the news this week is the UMA Protocol team’s new Synthetic Token Builder service, which allows users to “build tokens that can track anything with a price feed.”  For now, the service is only live on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet, meaning its not out in the wild just yet. However, the testnet version is an excellent indication of the kind of products that are coming — and from anyone that wants to release them. As UMA Protocol’s financial engineer Regina Cai explained on the news: How’s it work exactly? Like so, Cai said in a Medium post: Such a dynamic will allow users to make a wide variety of unique tokens, ranging from tokens that are pegged to the Chinese yuan to tokens that are pegged to Facebook’s stock price. Within the cryptoverse, the UMA Protocol project is known for launching the USStocks project earlier this year, which created a token that represented “synthetic ownership of an index of the 500 largest exchange-listed US stocks.” “USStocks is an exciting example of how decentralized finance can unlock economic opportunities for people regardless of geography or income level,” MakerDAO chief executive officer Rune Christensen said at the time. Relatedly, whatever happens with the UMA team’s latest service, it’s clear that the frictionless nature of tokenization continues to march on.",

        "passage": "In September 2017, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch branch asked 200 institutional investors what they believe is the most popular investment. Most of them said “Long Bitcoin.” That said, this doesn’t mean these investors have put money into the digital asset. However, it does show the government how vital cryptocurrencies are in the long run. But, that doesn’t change the fact that the crypto market needs institutional investors to take off. Thankfully, there is some hope in that regard thanks to recent developments.  As of this writing, “established financial institutions” are finally preparing to work with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Groups like Fidelity, one of the biggest asset managers in the world, revealed it would start supporting crypto trading and offer custody platforms within the next few months. Then, we have the Intercontinental Exchange which is getting ready for a Bitcoin futures exchange called Bakkt. Later, other places like American universities such as MIT and Harvard are creating cryptocurrency funds. This is just the start. It remains to be seen, then, why the value of Bitcoin hasn’t taken off despite these accomplishments. Instead, market optimists are looking for any small positives we can find. Unfortunately, Bitcoin broke the $6,000 low investors had established for it late last year and is now stuck around $3,000. Whales are holding steady, but new investors are failing to enter the market. Plus, we need institutional investors over smaller common ones. Of course, a significant limitation here is a lack of any framework for investors to follow regarding Bitcoin. P.A.I.D. Strategies recently released a report that claims 68% of Bitcoin exchanges across the United States and Europe aren’t even compliant towards know-your-customer policies. Plus, a decent amount of these exchanges can’t even liquify Bitcoin or other assets. That’s not a good pitch for new investors with lots of money to enter the market. John Devlin, a head analyst at P.A.I.D. spoke on this: Of course, this burden relies mostly on cryptocurrency exchanges, as these are key entry points into the digital asset market. Fortunately, Tony Sio, the head of surveillance and marketplace at Nasdaq, recently spoke on the matter, saying that crypto exchanges are doing what they can to improve their offerings. He goes on, speaking to Business Insider and saying that a decent amount of exchanges are asking Nasdaq to use their SMARTS Trade Surveillance system. This network is used by traditional exchanges, brokers, and regulatory officials to watch over trading and keep an eye on possible market manipulation. That said, because Nasdaq screens platforms before allowing them into the SMARTS platform, Sio claims that he’s seen a good amount of crypto platforms with poor KYC/AML policies. To be fair, these barriers aren’t always easy to implement. “If you are a startup, it is quite hard to set up because it requires a fair bit of work to set it up fully in place,” says Sio. “That is probably one of the sticking points.” Nevertheless, some crypto exchanges have been approved by Nasdaq. Those in the green are utilizing surveillance technology, trading engines, clearing engines, and more. This is a great sign, as it shows exchanges are putting effort into showing themselves as ideal candidates to follow. If this continues, institutional investors will be more likely to jump into the market despite volatility and other longstanding issues.",

        "passage": "Excessive volatility is probably one of the main obstacles standing in the way between cryptocurrencies and mass adoption, however, new hope emerges in the market of digital assets as bitcoin (BTC) recorded the lowest volatility rate by far, indicating that the cryptocurrency might be slowly acquiring increased stability in oppose to previous market trends. According to Dow Jones Market Data on bitcoin’s volatility, the top traded cryptocurrency showed the least volatile trading range by far, opposing high volatility levels as previously seen, especially during major dips in the market back in November 2018.  Bitcoin reached 7.8 percent in volatility, which is a rather narrow trading range, even more so when compared to the previous lowest volatility score that ranged to 21.2 percent, as recorded back at the beginning of 2017. The average volatility rate in the period from October 2013 to October 2018 is set at 53.7 percent, which makes the progress even more obvious. As bitcoin has set another record, this time positive, analysts and people from the industry consider that the case of bitcoin reaching the lowest volatility by far may be a sign of positive changes as well.  Even though cryptocurrency sceptics such as Nouriel Roubini, an economist who had debated on the fact that excessive volatility which included 100 percent trading ranges as seen back in 2017, believe that bitcoin and digital assets based on the same underlying technology have multiple shortcomings described in Roubini’s Testimony. The CEO of a UK-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, Danny Scott, believes that declining volatility should have positive effects on the general interest in cryptocurrency. Opinions are divided however, Roubini remains firm about his views on the cryptocurrency market in the testimony for a Senate hearing that took place in October. The testimony is called “Exploring the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain System” and it clearly pushes a negative momentum for cryptocurrency market as Roubini writes that “Crypto is the Mother of All Scams and (Now Busted) Bubbles While Blockchain Is the Most Over-Hyped Technology Ever, No Better than a Spreadsheet/Database” in form of a subtitle for his testimony. Roubini further describes bitcoin as a poor store of value due to the high volatility levels that often reach up to 30 percent in a single day, which in Roubini’s opinion represents one of the main reasons why bitcoin adoption is poor among merchants alongside the lack of stability in the market of digital assets. Danny Scott is confident that more people will decide to invest in bitcoin with the declining volatility and increasing stability, which should consequently push BTC closer to adoption. Despite high hopes that bitcoin’s latest record provided to crypto enthusiasts and market watchers who are positive about cryptocurrency market, host of Tales from the Crypt, Marty Bent, shared that he doesn’t believe that the low volatility levels will resist market trends, while Bent stresses out that declines in March are more likely a consequence of “exhaustion” in the market of digital assets than a sign of maturation. Bent further added that it is less likely that an asset such as bitcoin has the ability to emerge with perfected scalability, sufficient decentralization and no volatility, not even in the period of a decade since its creation. However, Tales from the Crypt host still believes that the market is on the right track, adding that once the network has a sufficient amount of value, volatility levels should likewise reach a satisfying dose of stability, although this process may take years.",

        "passage": "Libra has undoubtedly become the talk of the town over recent weeks. Since being unveiled just one month ago, the cryptocurrency has been mentioned by giants in technology, finance, and politics — Donald Trump included. On Tuesday, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon hopped on the Libra bandwagon, actually taking some time to bash the project while lauding his own take on digital assets — the privatized JPM Coin.  Libra has been expected by some analysts, including legendary Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos, to usurp traditional banks. In fact, in a recent video published to his Youtube channel, Antonopoulos claimed that retail banks should be scared of what the Facebook-backed cryptocurrency will bring to the table. While he isn’t a fan of the relative centralized nature of Libra in comparison to, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Greek-British coder explains that by virtue of Facebook having billions of clients, banks’ hegemony will be lost. This could mean that if Wall Street’s biggest names don’t launch similar projects or put pressure on Libra, their profits will falter, as will the value of their stock. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan isn’t fazed, however. Far from. Speaking to analysts in a conference call that has been cited by CNBC, the banking mogul noted that he does not feel threatened by Libra at all. He specifically looks to the fact that blockchain has been a technological trend for “seven years” and that “very little has happened”, presumably proposing that Libra will be more of a marketing ploy than a viable technology. “We’re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn’t spend too much time on it”, Dimon added. What’s more, Dimon made it clear that any new sorties into the financial services industry, be it Libra from Facebook & Co. or Bitcoin, will require proper regulatory approval, especially after the financial crisis and 9/11. He stated: While Dimon is totally cool with Libra, for now anyway, politicians on The Hill and across governments the world over seem to be running scared. On Tuesday and Wednesday, different committees in Washington, D.C. hosted Facebook’s head of Calibra/Blockchain David Marcus and experts in finance and cryptocurrency alike to talk about the potential effects of Libra. On Wednesday, the sole House Representative of Guam, San Nicolas, asserted that Libra could be a massive systemic risk in the United States. He simply proved his point by noting that even if a portion of Facebook’s over two billion active users had $100 worth of Libra in their wallets, outflows of the U.S. dollars (and other fiat currencies and government securities for that matter) would be massive, potentially posing a threat to the stability of the economy. California’s Brad Sherman, a staunch Bitcoin critic that recently called on Congress to “ban all cryptocurrency”, likened Libra to innovation that may be as bad as Bin Laden’s 9/11. Sherman is fearful that Libra could be used for terrorist financing and other illicit activities, just as the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Donald Trump mentioned in their respective comments on the recent resurgence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Congress has yet to take any clear action, presumably because they can’t really, but Representatives and Maxine Waters have continued to call for a moratorium on Libra’s development. Marcus has only “committed” to making sure “everything is right” before the launch of Libra, neither giving a yes or no to Waters’ inquiries.",

        "passage": "Greed just leads to trouble – several people in the crypto space can attest to this. One man, Homero Joshua Garza, who’s company has been accused of running a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme, has recently been sentenced to 21 months in prison by a federal judge for allegedly giving into greed.  The crypto arena appears marred with those who would manipulate a new and growing form of financial technology for their own benefit. Recently, it’s been discovered that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) are fake and have made off with millions of dollars in investors’ hard-earned cash. New ventures raise money for their operations by selling new coins that users will need to access the companies’ products and services. The trouble is, many of them disappear halfway through. Operations never come to fruition, and while the executives still make off with all that cash, those who invested their funds wind up in a monetary gutter. While this case doesn’t involve an ICO, the notion was clearly the same. Greed became the primary factor behind the business, and the man in charge is paying the price. Garza pled guilty last year to one count of wire fraud after his company GAW Miners ran an alleged Ponzi scheme that garnered roughly $9 million from thousands of people across the globe.  Garza, during better times. Image from Bitcoin.com Following his near two-year long prison sentence, Garza will have to undergo three years of supervised release and pay the $9 million back. Prosecutors were particularly blunt in their case against Garza, commenting that he “lied to investors and customers and took their money.” GAW Miners – short for “Geniuses at Work” Miners – first came about in 2014. The business made a name for itself reselling mining rigs and began as a legitimate enterprise. Unfortunately, by the end of the year, bitcoin’s hash rate had increased significantly, which rendered the company’s mining software null and void. Garza was unable to pay back his initial investors and tried to fix things by creating his own altcoin, later dubbed “Pay Coin.” Garza allegedly offered each coin at $20 and made false claims of a $100 million reserve. The currency also touted its own cloud-based mining and wallet services, neither of which existed, and used money from new investors to pay old ones. When Garza’s brother Carlos was issued a subpoena in 2015 to appear before Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyers in Boston, he responded to each question with: In their sentencing memorandum, federal prosecutors write: Garza explained in a phone interview that GAW began because of scammers. When he first heard about bitcoin, Garza was intrigued by the technology and spent $100,000 on a mining rig he never received. Though he refused to say which company he had purchased from, the situation led to much frustration and he decided to start a company to try and fix things. He says that GAW Miners made over $1 million in its first month, and that the company had over 100,000 customers at one time, with roughly 10,000 to 15,000 new accounts being added each day. Garza submitted a three-page apology to the judge overseeing his case and admitted that while the company began with a “legitimate purpose,” it eventually became a tool for greed. The letter explains: Garza has been ordered to report to prison on January 4, 2019.",

The G20 is meeting soon in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and apparently taxing cryptos will be on the agenda. Jiji.com reports that the G20 has drafted a document that calls for, “a taxation system for cross-border electronic payment services.” The details of the system are still very much unknown, and implementing any global taxation system would be a daunting task.  As Jiji.com is a Japanese-based news outlet, they focused on how these laws could affect Japanese businesses and individuals. At the moment, companies who do, “not have a factory or other base in Japan,” are immune from local taxation. Clearly, the initiative proposed by the G20 would likely change that. There are numerous hurdles to overcome if cryptos are going to be taxed, or even regulated to any great degree. Today there are numerous above-the-board crypto exchanges, but they generally cater to a clientele that is looking to invest or speculate. Cryptos are a nearly perfect way to launder money, and there is absolutely nothing stopping them from being used to do so. Of course, this is basically the case for the established system as well. The Goldman-Sachs Implicated, 1MDB scandal, took place with the cooperation of US banking executives, who are subject to a strict regulatory environment. The US regulations that exist to prevent fraud and money laundering did nothing to stop it, which put the role of banking regulation into serious question. A tax on cryptos or an international regulatory framework is likely going to be extremely complex, and much like international laws, very difficult to enforce. The rising tensions between major nations is also cause for concern, especially when it comes to laws that would require a high degree of cooperation to be effective. People all over the world are already paying taxes on just about everything, cryptos included. One young crypto investor found out how complex the existing tax laws can be, and is on the hook for around $400,000 USD.  Read: Student Cryptocurrency Trader Turns Huge Profits in to a $400k Tax Bill A young man in the USA was initially lucky and bought around 125,000 ETH at $50 USD in 2017. His good luck continued, and by the end of his run, the assets he bought ad sold netted him a profit of almost $1 million USD. According to Coinbase (and the IRS), “Gains on digital currency sales and exchanges are taxable in the US. For reference, here are the IRS guidelines for reporting digital asset gains. We understand taxes for digital currency can be complicated, so we updated our tax tools to make reporting easier.” We all know what happened next. The bottom fell out of the market, and like many traders, the young man in question keep on going. As it stands today, his digital assets are worth around $125,000, and he owes the US government a lot more than that. This is just one example of how government regulations can create nightmare scenarios, and there are few safeguards in place to help people stay on the right side of a very murky body of law. International crypto taxes would likely be even more difficult to understand, or even enforce. There is another issue that regulators that want to tax cryptos will almost certainly face. As the last few decades have shown, there are no shortage of tax loopholes out there. If there was a movement towards greater international taxation, it would likely be met with even more ingenious ways of avoiding taxes. The Panama Papers showed that many of the highest people in governments are using tax-avoidance techniques which seem simple when compared to what is possible when cryptos enter the equation. An asset that is designed to be anonymous will be taxed and regulated isn’t going to be straightforward at all, any attempt to do so will probably cost a tremendous amount of money, and be moderately effective, at best.",

        "passage": "The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) just released the results of a test they performed on a blockchain network they created in cooperation with the University of Sydney. According to an announcement that CSIRO made after the test was completed, their new blockchain network can process 30,000 international transactions per second.  Data61 at CSIRO and Concurrent Systems Research Group (CSRG) from the University of Sydney are responsible for creating the new network, which is called Red Belly Blockchain. CSIRO reported that, “The benchmark was set by sending 30,000 transactions per second from different geographic regions.” According to the same announcement the network was tested with 1,000 nodes in 14 countries, including Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. The slow transaction speed of first-generation blockchain platforms like Bitcoin have been a major source of criticism for blockchain. Proof-of-work systems seem to be at the heart of these problems. The new network uses a different algorithm, called deterministic byzantine consensus. The new platform seems to be much faster, which could open up doors for blockchain technology. It isn’t a secret that blockchain platforms have been difficult to scale-up to the needs of the global economy. The Red Belly Blockchain is designed to overcome scalability issues, and appears to be going in the right direction. The seemingly successful trial was deployed using Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) global cloud infrastructure. Dr. Vincent Gramoli, who is a senior researcher at Data61 and head of the CSRG said that, CSIRO is working with IBM to create what some are calling the Australian National Blockchain as well. It is interesting to see that a national science agency is working to develop real-world solutions for a cutting-edge technology. Australian banks and companies have also been working hard to make blockchain-based systems practical for industry and consumers. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) developed a proprietary blockchain system that was tested during the summer. They developed a blockchain-based platform to help exporters take advantage of the gains in efficiency that blockchain can create for the global logistics industry. They successfully used their system to coordinate a shipment of almonds from Australian farmers to European importers. The platform that CBA developed was only used to track the shipment of almonds, but it could also grow into a trade finance platform as well. Many major Asian banks are developing blockchain-based trade finance systems, that could be deployed into the market at any time. Power Ledger is another Australian blockchain firm that appears to be having success in the real world. They recently partnered with Aussie real estate heavyweight Vicinity to manage the electrical power in the Castle Plaza mall, which is located in Adelaide, South Australia.  Read: Beginner’s Guide to Power Ledger The partnership is part of Vicinity’s $75 million AUD solar energy program, that seeks to help Vicinity utilize their solar assets at optimum efficiency. Power Ledger’s platform will help Vicinity to choose between their own solar power, and the national electrical grid. Justin Mills, the executive general manager of Vicinity commented on why blockchain could help companies and consumers get the most for their money Power Ledger is also helping businesses in Bangkok’s Sukhumvit district trade electrical power with each other. The platform that Power Ledger designed went live in Bangkok last month, and allows 635 Kw of solar power to be traded between four entities in one of Thailand’s richest areas. If the pilot program is successful, Power Ledger’s platform could be used in more than 30 other projects in Thailand.",

        "passage": "Blockchain development costs aren’t cheap. Singapore-based company Morpheus Labs thinks that their Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform could help blockchain adoption to spread. The company has developed a platform that can help companies who want to create blockchain-based solutions, and it has been getting a lot of attention recently. Anything that leverages blockchain’s potential to create efficiency is probably going to be a good place to be. The blockchain industry is projected to grow into a $20 billion+ USD industry by 2023, which is a compound annual growth rate of 80%. That may be why Morpheus Labs has been cementing partnerships with a wide range of companies, as well as some big names in the education space.  So far Morpheus Labs has created working relationships with NULS, VeChain, QuarkChain, NeuroChain Tech and NEM, among others. The company’s tie-up with VeChain is especially interesting, as it is working to create enterprise-level blockchain applications that could be scaled up to take on the jobs that bigger companies like IBM have been able to land. IBM is currently using their version of Hyperledger to replace numerous archaic information systems. One of the most prominent is the IBM Food Trust, which is being onboarded by Walmart to keep track of its leafy green veggy supply chain. The implications for the platform are enormous, and it is possible that IBM will solidify a first-mover advantage in the blockchain space because of their existing assets and connections. Morpheus Labs CEO Chuang Pei-Han commented to Forbes that, The idea that a company could access ready-made blockchain architecture that could be adapted to their needs turns the current blockchain development space upside down. Instead of having to contract bespoke blockchain development services, companies could get blockchain working for them, with a minimum amount of money spent. Having open access to inexpensive blockchain architecture also opens up the field for new ideas, which don’t need millions of dollars to bring into beta testing. Blockchain has been an esoteric development space, but that seems to be changing. Morpheus Labs is also working with universities to create more blockchain developers. The company recently welcomed EMBA students and researchers from Tsinghua University and National Taiwan Normal University. Tsinghua University also has formal connections with Ripple Labs, another company that is looking to grow the blockchain space via expanded education options. Pei-Han commented that, “The key to a good partnership is not always looking at surface level value. Strategic planning and outlook help pick the right long-term partner. The basis of a partnership should always complement each company in term of needs,” in the same Forbes article. At this point, the blockchain development space is just coming into its own. Companies like Morpheus Labs are important to the blockchain space, as they give SMEs more options for how they can develop blockchain platforms. As prices for blockchain development drop, the industry is likely to feed on its own success in a virtuous cycle. The major question then pivots to cryptos, and how they will fit into the new blockchain-based record keeping systems. Companies like PowerLedger have demonstrated how powerful blockchain can be in alternative energy systems, but they require that transactions are settled outside of the established financial system. In order for blockchain to deliver maximum efficiency, it is likely that the existing financial system, with fiat currency included, is replaced by a currency that allows blockchain to deliver the cost savings it is capable of creating.",

        "passage": "On Monday afternoon, video footage of police officers at an office festooned with Tron (TRX) logos was found on Twitter. In an impassioned tweet, a user speculated that the officers, which sported uniforms of the Beijing fuzz, were raiding the office. China is, of course, a country that has recently done its best to curb the adoption of Bitcoin and assets it can’t control.  As the footage was shared, a large sum of TRX tokens was transferred to Huobi, leading many to believe that the raid thesis was accurate. But, the Chinese cryptocurrency startup, the brainchild of Justin Sun, recently came out to clear the air, providing its community with an explanation for this whole debacle. On Monday, Blockonomi drew attention to a resurgence in crypto-related Ponzi schemes. The most notable of those that were mentioned was named “Wave Field Super Community”, which touted itself as a Super Representative of the Tron blockchain. According to individuals that read and could translate the firm’s marketing material, lofty returns were promised. Of course, everything was too good to be true. Prior to its shutdown, the scheme managed to secure over $30 million worth of Chinese yuan from thousands of gullible investors within six months’ time. Wave Field Super Community’s tactics were so damaging that local media reports that a single mother killed herself over the lost funds, which she borrowed from a neighbor and was unable to pay back. This death, coupled with the loss of many families’ savings, has led to an uproar in China. And this uproar, according to a Medium blog post from Tron, led to a number of angry victims taking to all forums possible to make their voices heard. One such forum was an office in Beijing that is affiliated with Tron, which is headquartered in San Francisco. On Monday, a number of enraged individuals tried to storm the office, crying that Tron is a scam because of its faux tacit affiliation with the scam. As such, the office, which is owned be Beijing research and development firm Raybo, called law enforcement to ensure that its employees were safe. In an announcement on the matter, Tron tried to further itself from the scam, claiming that it denounced the company earlier this year on its Chinese social media pages, along with other channels in English. It is clear that these denunciations were ineffective, as made evident by the pseudo-protest at Raybo and the purported suicide.  It is unclear what occurred after police arriving at the office, but the arrival presumably resulted in the victims being escorted off the premises. This unfortunate tidbit of news comes as China’s crypto scene has seen a monumental resurgence, a resurgence that has not been replicated in the West and in other parts of the world. Firstly, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have entered back into the Chinese mainstream conscious. Data from WeChat (top app in China), Baidu (China’s Google), and other digital services, show exponential upticks in search interest and mentions of cryptocurrency and related terms. And arguably more importantly, the government is looking at the industry again. In fact, a recent report from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post confirms that the People’s Bank of China is actively discussing the creation of a digital Yuan. Whether or not such a project will be based on a blockchain remains to be seen. But, this marks a massive turning point in the future of this industry, as one of the world’s largest financial institutions announcing intentions to host its own cryptocurrency does, in the eyes of some, validate the technology.",

The real estate project cost a reported £250 million ($325 million), and it was developed by Scottish fashion designer and parliamentarian Baroness Michelle Mone, and her partner Douglas Barrowman, a Scottish investor and the Chairman of the Knox Group of Companies.  The couple launched the real estate project back in 2017, touting it as the first housing project where tenants could pay in Bitcoin. At the time, Barrowman had explained to CNBC on why they chose the cryptocurrency, describing Bitcoin as an emerging trend that would one day become a more mainstream means of investment. Barrowman had said: At its launch, Mone and Barrowman promised to complete construction by the summer of 2019, saying that they would be offering 150 out of the 1,300 apartments on the project to investors who could pay in Bitcoin. The couple reported to Business Insider in February 2018 that they had successfully sold 50 of the apartments already. Speaking with the financial news medium, Mone claimed that some buyers bought two apartments each, while one person even bought as many as ten. As at the time of the sale announcement, the properties that were on offer ranged from simple studios, priced at $130,000 a piece (roughly 15.5 BTC as at then) to two-bedroom apartments that went for $380,000 (about 45 BTC). The project’s website shows that studios and two-bedroom apartments are now being offered for as low as 9 BTC. However, the site also points out that the listing prices are pegged to the value of BTC to the US Dollar as at January 8, 2018, which means that 9 BTC would amount to roughly $147,000 (as opposed to its value of $48,780 at press time. The reason for Aston’s suspension is still unknown. However, that isn’t to say that other companies aren’t doing their bit to revolutionize the real estate market. Last week, Smartlands, a British blockchain firm, announced that it would be launching its platform in a matter of weeks. The Smartlands platform would provide liquidity in the real estate market by allowing developers to issue tokens that are linked to a specific property. The tokens can be bought and traded both on the platform and in a secondary crypto market. The company’s announcement, which was published on April 26, gave users an overview of how the platform will work. Smartlands’ CEO Arnold Nauseda also noted that the tokens would allow investors to hold a fraction of a building’s equity. Investors get their returns in the form of rent, and on property sales.",

        "passage": "This week, tech giant Microsoft and banking heavyweight JP Morgan announced a strategic partnership that will revolve around the duo boosting enterprise adoption of Morgan’s in-house private fork of Ethereum, Quorum. To do that, Microsoft is welcoming Quorum as the inaugural blockchain on its Azure cloud platform, specifically the new Azure Blockchain Service that the company launched on May 2nd. The new Azure arm will allow customers to leverage blockchain solutions in streamlined fashion. The adoption-focused meld will allow enterprises working with blockchain tech “to shift their focus from infrastructure management to application development, ultimately driving transformative business value,” the two companies said in their announcement.  It’s a win-win deal, of course. With Morgan’s Quorum now in Azure’s stable, Microsoft has advanced on its competitor Amazon, which launched its own Amazon Managed Blockchain service this past Tuesday. As for JP Morgan, its Quorum platform now has first-mover advantage in ushering in enterprise developers on Microsoft’s flagship blockchain service. JP Morgan blockchain head Umar Farooq hailed the collaboration as a milestone that would expand Quorum’s appeal: Microsoft has also committed to offering “engineering, consulting and go-to-market support for Quorum.” In extension, participating enterprises will be able to leverage the Azure Blockchain Workbench, which was launched last year and allows companies to readily build blockchain apps. It’s full steam ahead for JP Morgan’s blockchain, then, but whether it remains the bank’s blockchain could still be up in the air. One year ago the bank’s leadership was reportedly considering whether to spin-off or repurpose Quorum as an independent project in order to boost the platform’s prospects. The current strategic partnership isn’t the first time Microsoft has turned to Quorum, either. The tech giant teamed up with “Big Four” accounting firm EY to build the “Rights and Royalties” blockchain, a royalties system for Xbox game developers underpinned by JP Morgan’s Ethereum fork. If winning clients over is the name of the game, then Microsoft couldn’t have picked a better partner than JP Morgan to bootstrap the Azure Blockchain Service. Why? The bank is using Quorum to build out an interbank blockchain rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN), that is focused on streamlining banking transactions among its members. And speaking of members, the IIN has no shortage of them. That’s because the network already boasts more than 200 participating banks to date, all of which are accordingly becoming acquainted and using Quorum. That’s 200 plus possible clients that the Azure Blockchain Service can win over if these institutions continue to work with Quorum and want to build associated apps. The IIN is also set to grow, too, as the project is poised to begin trialing cross-border settlements (watch out Ripple!) later this year. If the trials prove fruitful, then the IIN’s numbers may eventually swell, making it so that more institutions will become familiar with Quorum. Back in February, when JP Morgan announced it was creating a stablecoin-like token dubbed JPM Coin, the aforementioned Farooq noted just how far the bank’s reach went regarding clientele: Microsoft would love to beat out Amazon in becoming the leading blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) choice among these markets — big corporations and major banks — and JP Morgan could be the ticket in actualizing that reality.",

        "passage": "DeepBrain Chain is one step closer to launching their AI development and exchange platform. The DeepToken they have designed will act as a currency and voting mechanism on their trading boards. There two initial trading boards will help Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects gain financial and technical support from backers who hold DeepTokens.  The exchanges that are be hosted by Huobi Cloud are a means of creating an investment environment for AI projects. So far the DeepBrain Chain Foundation has given their support to OneGame, and EtainPower. The exchanges that facilitate the trade in DeepTokens will help other AI projects to be discovered by the AI community, and develop via the “Voting Mining” method. Instead of receiving direct support from the DeepBrain Chain Foundation, the new exchanges, and DeepToken, will allow other interested parties to enter the AI development space. It will also help smaller AI developers to benefit from larger players who have more money and experience. According to the DeepToken whitepaper, the mission of DeepToken is to discover the best new projects in the field of AI. The whitepaper describes their idea in these terms: In a practical sense, the Voting Mining system will allow both of the exchanges to list AI projects and companies every three months. The listing rules between the two exchanges vary, with the Institution Trading Board giving priority to entities that hold 100 million or more DeepTokens. The bottom line is that the Voting Mining mechanism is very inclusive, and will give DeepToken holders a direct connection with the AI projects that are listed on the exchanges. In addition to access to talent, the Voting Mining system creates an atmosphere where token holders have to learn about the AI projects they are supporting, which may act as a form of inter-industry marketing. There isn’t any way around it; AI development is expensive. It should come as no surprise that some of the first AI platforms to see commercialization have come from companies like Google and Amazon. These industry heavyweights have literally billions of dollars to pump into AI development, which leaves smaller players in the AI space at a relative disadvantage.  Read: Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Blockchain: Thinking Our Way to a Brighter Future? Hopefully the access to both support and funding that DeepToken creates will be beneficial to smaller AI companies that have ideas that could grow into new markets. The DeepBrain Chain Foundation’s investment in EtainPower is a good example of how the Foundation approaches investment, and the kind of project they see as being valuable. EtainPower is looking for ways to use blockchain and micro-finance in the electrical grid. Power Ledger is working on a similar platform, which is scheduled to go into operation in Bankok in the near future. The idea behind both platforms appears to be marketable, and will help small-scale power producers trade power in the most efficient way possible. Other larger companies are also working on the same idea, though the smaller players seem to be able to bring working systems to market faster. DeepBrain Chain’s DeepToken platform is probably hitting the market at the right time. They are planning to launch the DeepToken platform over the rest of the year, with full DeepToken/fiat interchangeability happening before December, 2018. The platform is already live in an alpha version, which will help the company troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Larger companies are having a lot of success with AI applications, and there are numerous areas where experts think that AI could play a vital role. Everything from healthcare to transportation is poised to benefit from the AI revolution, and DeepToken could be a help to smaller companies that have great ideas.",

From the world of arts to the thrill dripping round leather game of football and basketball, blockchain continues to make its entrant like the ‘big fish.’ The next port of call which many are keen on exploring is franchising, according to an op-ed on Forbes by Ed Teixeira, Chief Operating Officer of Franchise Grade, a franchise research firm in New York. It is no gainsaying that the intrinsic features of blockchain technology make it applicable to a wide range of businesses that are not even related to cryptocurrencies—it’s most popular use case.  The use of blockchain in combination with other innovative technologies is yielding great results in supply chain management processes as well as in promoting efficient healthcare systems. Teixeira highlights the potential that abounds in the possible use of blockchain technology in franchising in his piece, which was the matter of discussion at the recent International Bar Association’s Franchise Law Committee meeting held in Italy. Legal Practitioner Craig Tractenberg who works at Fox Rothschild LLP stated at the meeting: Disruptive technologies are known for removing the need for the middleman in most transaction arrangement, which could nevertheless still yield efficient processes and less commission remitted to third parties depending on the type of business. Smart contracts could also be used in the peer-to-peer approach, which are self-gratifying agreements that are closed once the required pre-determined conditions are fulfilled. Tractenberg expatiate on this while making references to a few platforms saying: It will be recalled that U.S. retailer Walmart Inc. recently introduced a system where suppliers of leafy greens are to implement blockchain technology for traceability and food safety.  Read: Walmart Requires Veggie Suppliers to use Blockchain to Trace Contamination Teixeira’s piece sees the introduction of reward programs as another means of using blockchain in the retail sector. Chanticleer Holding which has been well-known for its stablecoins (American Burger and Hooters) introduced a loyalty program for Hooters. The group’s CEO Michael Pruitt had stated at the time: Certain players in the beauty industry have also made plans to reward their faithful clients with crypto, which will not only enhance their customer base but will also increase the usage and adoption of cryptocurrency in the retail industry. Europe’s fastest growing energy provider Restart Energy initiated the first blockchain franchise – RED-P – using a model that afford entrepreneurs the opportunity to show their managerial finesse through the energy business. Entrepreneurs were required to own a certain amount of MWAT tokens which gave them the access to trade as much as 1MWAT on the RED-P platform. A minimum of 10,000 tokens (Red City Franchise) allows holders to sell energy in their city of residence while MWAT tokens within the range of 10,000,000 or more give holders the exclusive right to own sub-franchises within his or her country of residence.",

According to a Reuters report on the matter, scammers ran a bogus ad, that has now been removed, that reportedly tried to convince users to buy Bitcoin from a company endorsed by De Mol.  The billionaire creator of the “Big Brother” reality television program is suing Facebook for not preventing the ads from running on its platform and for dragging its feet on removing the fraudulent ads when complaints were sent in. Del Mol’s lawyers are asking the Amsterdam District Court to call Facebook to order. According to them, Dutch consumers had lost around 1.7 million Euros ($1.9 million) to celebrity-backed scams. They want the court to order the social media giant to create a filter that automatically blocks ads that mentions De Mol’s name along with cryptocurrency, which they argue had caused the media magnate reputational damage. This is not the first time a celeb has faulted Facebook for not doing enough to prevent bogus ads for running on its platform. TODAY SHOW’s Co-Host Georgie Gardner slammed the tech giant in 2018 for not rejecting an ad that used her image to defraud citizens. Facebook’s legal representative Jens van den Brink said that Facebook could not be forced to change its procedures on ads monitoring and processing for an individual. He explained that Facebook has a reporting system that allows customers to report ads that are deemed to be inappropriate and that the company removed the Del Mol’s bogus and once the complaints were filed by members of the community. Judge Remmine Dudok van Heel who presided over the hearing questioned Van den Brink on Facebook’s vetting process and on whether the tech company checked the webpages the ads link to. Facebook’s director of product management Rob Leathern told reporters that the tech company takes the issue of fraudulent ads seriously and was proactively working to stopping them from reoccurring in the future. He was quoted in the Reuters report saying: Celebrity-backed scams have increased all across Europe. In the UK, Action Fraud reported that victims had lost £27m to these scams from 2018 till date. Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to consumers to watch out for crypto schemes that were being promoted using celebrity images and in some rare occasions prestigious addresses to lure investors. In Australia, celebrity-backed scams are on a winning streak.

Crypto advocates say these recruitments could be some of the first tricklings toward mainstream adoption for the fledgling technologies.  On March 20th, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey posted a series of tweets in which he announced that a new Square Crypto initiative would be launching and that he was looking to hire a handful of Bitcoin Core or cryptoverse experts to fill out the positions: Square Cash, the company’s payments platform, surged into being the most widely downloaded financial app on the Apple iOS and the Google Play Store in late 2018 after the app began offering bitcoin (BTC) buys and sells to its users earlier in the year. However, per Dorsey, Square Crypto will be a non-commercial and open-source initiative whose resulting releases, whatever they may be, will be offered for free for the benefit and betterment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Likely boding further crypto inroads for both Twitter and Square, Dorsey later added that he was becoming fascinated with, and enthusiastically embracing, the cryptocurrency community: The Square CEO concluded his announcement in noting that interested prospects could reach out via the new Square Crypto Twitter account to apply: A new position has been listed as open on the Facebook Careers page: Lead Commercial Counsel, Blockchain.  Any takers? Image via Facebook Careers As the posting explains, the Menlo Park position would center around contracts for Facebook’s commercial blockchain initiatives: The posting doesn’t come as a surprise. The Silicon Valley social media powerhouse has been ramping up its blockchain activities in recent times, so commercial endeavors may be just around the corner. Back in February, the Facebook blockchain team hired a handful of blockchain engineers from crypto company Chainspace, presumably for the team’s expertise in smart contracts. Later that month, company co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was looking at replacing the Facebook Connect authentication system with some form of distributed, blockchain-based tech. Another major related revelation came through recent reporting that Facebook’s “basketcoin” — a stablecoin pegged to several assets instead of one — was far enough along in its development that the company was already talking to cryptocurrency exchanges to prep for listing the coin. The grand takeaway here is that Facebook’s crypto and blockchain plans are accelerating, and the company is taking serious steps to foster that acceleration. Other major companies may be following suit shortly per Facebook’s rather glaring example.",

        "passage": "Over the past day, Bitcoin has collapsed. After mucking about the $10,000 support level for a number of days, the cryptocurrency fell by 5% in under an hour, shedding $500 and losing a number of key technical levels. Interestingly, Michael Novogratz, a former Wall Street investor turned cryptocurrency proponent, is unfazed. In a recent interview, he asserted that the Bitcoin price is ready to move higher once again.  Bitcoin is poised to head higher, according to Novogratz in a recent interview with Bloomberg. He argued that now, institutional investors will begin to make a true foray into the cryptocurrency game. Indeed, Bakkt, the cryptocurrency futures exchange and infrastructure provider that has been backed by the Intercontinental Exchange and Microsoft, is launching its institutional products in the coming weeks. In fact, Bakkt recently revealed it will be launching its Bitcoin custody service on September 6th, which will be followed by the activation of its Bitcoin futures contracts on September 23rd. Cryptocurrency analysts bill the new exchange as one of the “most bullish” institutional events to ever grace the cryptocurrency industry. You see, Bakkt is expected to allow for many of Wall Street’s institutions to make their first allocations towards Bitcoin, having been approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and backed by veterans of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. What’s interesting is that preliminary discussions already indicate there is institutional demand for such a product. Fundstrat Global Advisors analyst Sam Doctor recently wrote on Twitter that at a Bakkt-sponsored event held in July, he felt as though there are a “critical mass” of institutions — everyone from market makers and liquidity providers to traders and hedge funds — ready to adopt Bakkt’s products. That’s not all. In a similar string of news, Coinbase’s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, wrote on Twitter that there is around $200 million to $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies deposited into Coinbase’s coffers each week from “institutional customers”. Novogratz’s call for Bitcoin to continue its push higher comes shortly after he asserted that the cryptocurrency market would enter a short period of consolidation, which he claimed would see BTC trade in a range around $8,500 to $14,000. While he didn’t mention a specific price target in this new interview, he told Bloomberg earlier that he expects for Bitcoin to shoot to $20,000 by “the middle or the end of the fourth quarter [of 2019].” While Novogratz is expecting for Bitcoin to continue on its merry way, he asserted in the same interview that cryptocurrency technologies are unlikely to impact the lives of mom and pop investors in the short run, claiming that this industry still needs another half-decade to impact society. He elaborated: Backing his point, he looked to Peloton Interactive, a home exercise startup that went live after years in development and took Wall Street by storm. Indeed, as of the time of writing, few cryptocurrencies actually have bonafide use cases. But, momentum in the development side of the industry is starting to trend higher once again. And with applications for this technologies comes adoption, and potential rallies in the prices of digital assets too. As Novogratz put it, “this is not a backwater experiment anymore, this is part of the financial infrastructure”.",

        "passage": "Environmental practices are now at the forefront of governmental policy objectives at every corner of the globe. Whilst global ambitions to live in a more sustainable world are now being discussed at a U.N. level, U.S. manufacturer SC Johnson are looking to utilize the power of blockchain technology to further incentivize society to play their part. According to an official SC Johnson press release, the manufacturer – who are behind global cleaning product brands such as Mr Muscle, Scrubbing Bubbles, Kiwi, Glade, Shout and Ziploc, are looking to collaborate with Plastic Bank, a leading environmental organization focused on reducing plastic ocean-based waste. The report explains that five nations in particular-  notably Thailand, Vietnam, China, Indonesia and the Philippines, are responsible for over 55% of all plastic waste dumped in to the world’s oceans. Taking this in to account, the project will initially begin in Indonesia, with the opening of 8 plastic collection sites across the country.  The idea behind the proposal is to reward individuals that deposit plastic waste at one of the regional centres, in the form of cryptocurrency. This acts as a major incentive for those involved as the report explains that the tokens can then be used to buy goods and services. Furthermore, as the project will be supported by blockchain technology, it practically alleviates the threats of loss or theft, ensuring that each centre remains transparent and accountable. SC Johnson explain that close to 28 million people live below the poverty line in Indonesia, so the incentivization program has the opportunity to benefit a vast group of demographics. With the first centre opening in Bali in late October 2018, it is hoped that Indonesia will have its 8 centres fully operational by May 2019. After that, the plan is to then begin operations in neighbouring Asian nations. Although it remains to be seen what specific blockchain protocol the project will be built on top of, the report suggests that users will be able to access their tokens via a bespoke Plastic Bank mobile application. This comes as welcome news for environmental think-tanks, as ocean pollution is on the brink of disaster. According to Marine Safe – a UK-based NGO, more than 215 million metric tonnes of plastics found their way in to the ocean in 2010. This isn’t the first time that a leading organization has looked to tackle global issues through the utilization of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In May 2017, it was announced that the U.N were looking to use the Ethereum blockchain to distribute food rations in the form of coupons, to refugees living in Jordan. By removing the need for physical cash, it drastically reduces the threats of aid donations getting in to the wrong hands However, it is also important to recognize that leading cryptocurrency projects also need to play their part too. With energy consumption levels growing at an exponential rate as a result of Proof-of-Work mining algorithms, it is estimated that Bitcoin alone demands more electricity than 159 different nations. Moreover, with the vast majority of mining farms based in China, a nation that has a somewhat murky reputation when it comes to environmental standards, many argue that the energy-intensive characteristics of cryptocurrency mining is counter-intuitive to the underlying aims of the digital phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to see that the use of cryptocurrencies is being considered by major organizations with the view of making the world a more sustainable place. Although still in its early days, it will interesting to see what effects the SC Johnson and Plastic Bank collaboration yields.",

        "passage": "According to a news release earlier this week, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) supported the development of a blockchain explorer. The new explorer was developed with help from the NRC’s Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). Blockchain start-up Bitaccess built the new platform, and it is hosted on the widely-used InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).  Bitaccess co-founder Moe Adham, had this to say about the program in a statement that was made after the new explorer was released, The NRC explained that they chose IPFS because it operates as a peer-to-peer file sharing network that is highly resistant to shock. Programs that are hosted on the IPFS are nearly impossible to change, or remove. Users can use this new explorer to locate information about public grants, and other subjects on the Ethereum blockchain. Canada wasn’t a major development center for cutting-edge technology in the 20th century, but that appears to be changing. Ethereum was more or less born in Canada, and numerous blockchain start-ups have chosen to make Canada their home.  Read: What is Interplanetary File System IPFS?  Canada’s financial markets are often overshadowed by their neighbor to the south. US financial markets are arguably the largest in the world, but Canada brings a lot of flexibility to innovators that can’t afford to deal with the huge costs of bureaucracy in the USA. The first crypto-miners to go public did so in Canada, due to the ease of doing business there. HIVE Blockchain was a market darling on the TSX-V (Toronto Venture Exchange) last year. Like most things in the crypto sector, it has since cooled off. Canada was also the first major nation to allow a blockchain ETF to list on their exchanges. Next month, it looks like another blockchain ETF is set to be listed for public trading.  Read: HIVE Blockchain Technologies: Publicly Listed Crypto Mining Company The blockchain ETF that Vancouver-based First Block Capital (FBC) plans to list next month won’t be the fabled Bitcoin ETF that US investors have been waiting for. Instead of focusing on the wildly volatile crypto sector, FBC plans to invest in major companies that are working with blockchain technology. FBC is looking at companies like IBM, Maserk and Walmart, probably because they are securing blockchain patents, and have the ability to take on long-term development programs. This ETF may not deliver the kind of returns that some tokens created last year, but over a long-term time horizon, it may prove to be a safer way to invest in the blockchain space. Mike Novogratz has been one of the most outspoken proponents for blockchain in the public arena. A former Goldman Sachs employee, he has been working to take his crypto merchant bank, called Galaxy Digital Holdings, public for more than a year. It finally happened at the beginning of August, though the current bear market in crypto prices hasn’t helped Galaxy much.  Read: Mike Novogratz’s Crypto Merchant Bank Loses Big In First Quarter Mike Novogratz had this to say right before Galaxy shares began trading on the TSX-V, Although the shares initially rose to over C$3, they have since fallen to C$2.35. Other companies like HIVE Blockchain, have seen even larger falls from the heady days of 2017. HIVE shares rallied as high as C$4.71, though they recently traded as low as C$.68. Regardless of the roller-coaster ride in crypto prices, Canada has shown that it is willing to accept blockchain technology, and allow start-ups to take the risks that can lead to great companies.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin took a blow yesterday via Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and is now trading for about $100 less than where it was yesterday afternoon. According to Armstrong, it will be many years before mass adoption occurs in the cryptocurrency space and bitcoin is used primarily as a form of payment instead of as an investment opportunity.  Read: Crypto Profiles: Brian Armstrong, The Founder of Coinbase One of the biggest problems facing bitcoin is its overall lack of adoption. For the most part, hype surrounding the cryptocurrency has fallen in mainstream media following its continual drops from last year’s peak price of $19,000+ in December. People were genuinely interested in the asset when the market was bullish, but now that things have calmed down, people are starting to turn away. In addition, many retailers and businesses do not accept bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as methods of payment for goods and services. The financial arena is still largely dominated and governed by cash and credit credits, and so long as this continues, bitcoin is not going to experience a fair shot. Sadly, Armstrong comments that it will be a while before this occurs. He says that bitcoin’s technology is still very immature, and that it needs more time to alleviate its continued price corrections and bubble activity: It’s ironic that Armstrong mentions Starbucks in the sense that the company has been at the center of controversy following its alleged partnership with Bakkt, the new platform from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) set to debut this coming November. Bakkt’s primary goal is to assist retail companies in buying, selling and trading digital currencies.  Read: Are Corporate Cryptocurrencies Coming? It was originally reported that the coffee king would be implementing the platform’s new virtual payment software to allow customers to purchase drinks, baked goods and assorted merchandise with crypto. However, Starbucks representatives have since retracted their statements suggesting that this would occur. While Armstrong has no doubt that real-world adoption will increase in due time, he is adamant that certain countries will limit or ban access to cryptocurrencies just as they do with the internet, and that trust for digital assets will never be a sure thing: However, where Armstrong is most confident is that third-world or developing nations facing economic turmoil will eventually turn to bitcoin and assorted forms of crypto as a means of fighting inflation and stabilizing their financial infrastructures: In related news, Coinbase appears to be doing better than ever, and alleges that approximately 50,000 new customers were signing up each day towards the end of last year. While it’s unknown how many customers are coming aboard now, the San Francisco-based digital exchange currently employs over 1,000 people, one-third of which are women. “It’s getting harder and harder to be a crypto skeptic,” Armstrong asserts.",

        "passage": "The Bank of Finland has released a paper called “The Great Illusion of Digital Currencies”. In it, author Aleksi Grym calls all cryptocurrencies “a fallacy”. The author argues that “currency cannot be digitized” and that blockchain-based ledger systems are “not significantly different from other financial record-keeping technology”.  Before we get into the paper, we need to consider where it’s coming from first. This paper was published by the Bank of Finland, which by no surprise is the central bank of Finland. According to Wikipedia, the bank is the country’s “monetary authority, and is responsible for the country’s currency supply”. Naturally, such an institution has a lot to lose in terms of control over global finance if something like bitcoin were to replace its freely printed fiat currency. With that in mind, let’s go over some of the key arguments posed in the paper. The author of the paper takes great pains in explaining why they believe the distributed letter technology of pioneered by bitcoin is not revolutionary or even new. By their definition, having a ledger that exists across multiple servers and updates automatically through the Internet is old news. This assertion, however, indicates a severe lack of understanding in what bitcoin actually represents. In a traditional, closed system where only pre-approved and trusted parties are given access to a distributed ledger (like a network of government owned banks), then perhaps on the surface this assertion would appear to be correct. A network like this could easily keep track of transactions and share data amongst each other so that a shared ledger is up to date. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that use any type of mining are trustless systems in which anyone can participate. It is this democratization of information that is the revolution, not the data sharing. In order for one to mine bitcoin, they do not need pre-approval, a license, or proprietary software in order to participate. It is this openness that also forces honesty and transparency. In a closed system of only pre-approved nodes, things can easily be manipulated upon the agreement of the small set of participants. For instance, in the case of digital money, this small network could easily just say to themselves, let’s print one hundred million dollars worth of currency and then give it out to our political allies, all with the public having no access to this information. On a system like bitcoin where everything is out in the open at all times, and anyone is allowed to participate without needing any kind of license or approval, this sort of underhanded tactic to undermine the value of the currency is effectively impossible.  Read The Problems with Fiat Currency If new bitcoin were to suddenly appear outside of the established rules, chaos would ensue. In the global fiat system, new money simply appears and disappears every day, and no-one bats an eye. One classic attack on cryptocurrencies from the old financial world is the tired and oft debunked claim that bitcoin has “no intrinsic value“. For this overused and malformed point, we refer to famed economist Saifedean Ammous who wrote The Bitcoin Standard. In his book, Ammous argues that money is a concept that appears in all human societies and can take many forms. Be it large stones, sea shells, beads, gold, minted coins, printed paper, and so on. The problem with most forms of money is that they lack or fail to maintain their hardness. Basically speaking, the more difficult a form of currency is to produce or acquire, the harder it is. Ammous writes: Gold, for example, cannot just be picked up anywhere on the ground. Getting gold from nature requires complex and expensive mining. Further, gold only exists on earth in a finite amount. And while gold may be a good store of value, it is not necessarily a good currency because it is not highly fungible, divisible, or easily verifiable. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are instead an ideal form of money because they have hardness, a fixed supply, and are effectively immune from hyperinflation and other manipulation by central banks that would act selfishly to print reams of cash only to accomplish their own selfish goals. While the author calls bitcoin a fallacy, the idea that a currency requires institutional backing of any kind is in itself a fallacy of logic. We would highly doubt that the Bank of Finland would consider gold to be a monetary asset that requires some sort of authority to back it. On the contrary, precious metals and gems require no central authority, central bank, or mint in order for them to hold any degree of value. The same is true for any number of commodities like chocolate or cement. A chocolate bar does not need to get a stamp from the “Central Chocolate Authority of Finland” in order to be considered real chocolate. The assertion that all objects that hold any degree of value need an institution of some kind put its stamp on it is foolhardy at best, and downright ignorant at worst.  Examining Wall Street’s Love-Hate Relationship with Bitcoin A large reason why bitcoin is so highly valued is simply because it does not require a central institution of any kind in order for it to operate and fulfill its primary function of being a means of storing and transacting value. Centralized authorities create central points of failure, and easy means of manipulation. Bitcoin suffers from none of these weaknesses, and that is not by accident, but by design. The entire argument made by this paper seems to come crashing down in its brief conclusion section. Specifically, the author states that if a central bank were to release its own cryptocurrency, then it would indeed be a true currency by the definition of the author. This is because it would then be “backed” by an institution, and not simply the creation of some computer geeks or anarchists. It is in this paragraph that we see the author specifies that cryptocurrencies could function as a currency, but they somehow assert that without a central issuing authority, any currency is destined to fail. Once again, we must point to the example of gold, in that there is no issuing authority that prints out gold. Instead, gold is a decentralized asset that exists within nature and is not owned or controlled by any one central body like a central bank. If a government were to create a cryptocurrency, it would only be hard money if it had a set supply and was immune to hyperinflation. If it could be endlessly printed or minted, then it would be just as subject to manipulation as any other form of fiat currency. It’s clear from this paper that the author from the Bank of Finland does not really understand cryptocurrency, beyond simply seeing as a threat to their own established means of control. They seem to view the features the bitcoin network very intentionally implemented as being weaknesses, instead of strengths. We here at Blockonomi would suggest that the Bank of Finland should take more time to really understand why people are attracted to cryptocurrency before simply slamming it for not fitting into the established paradigm of centralized and highly manipulated fiat currency markets.

        "passage": "It was Day 2 of Facebook’s Congressional Hearing. The pressure was on the social media giant to present a strong case to the House. A strong group that has never been a fan of the social media giant. After a rather grueling day of being questioned by the Senate Banking Committee, David Marcus, Facebook’s Blockchain Chief, headed to the House of Representatives to face questions from the House Committee of Financial Services.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D CA), the Chairperson of the Committee, was the first lawmaker to raise concerns about the Libra and Facebook, and pretty much turn the attention of Capitol Hill to the company’s crypto efforts. Once again, Marcus faced the uphill task of convincing lawmakers that despite its past, Libra would be different.  “Ultimately, if Facebook’s plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments,” she stated. Waters jabbed at Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, where it was reported that malicious Russian state operatives purchased ads on the platform to influence the outcome of the election that produced President Trump. However, if the Senate hearing was considered difficult, Marcus and Facebook were met with a brick wall at the House. Here, the general consensus was pretty much the same; Facebook’s past makes it near impossible for anyone to trust them with their paychecks.  However, while a lot of lawmakers were quick to recommend that the social media giant should close up shop before even launching, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) proposed that Facebook could launch Libra to a million users as a pilot program, doing so with significant regulatory oversight. In part, Maloney said, “I don’t think you should launch Libra at all because the creation of a new currency is a core government function. But at the very least you should agree to do this small pilot program first.” Facebook’s Blockchain Head said that the tech giant had already thought of this approach. He added that a part reason why they announced the whitepaper on time was to allow for regulatory scrutiny. After the event, there was a big reveal. Facebook had reportedly kept the Swiss regulators in the dark. This is ironic, because just yesterday, Marcus had informed the Senate that Libra would be overseen by the Swiss data protection agency. In part, he had stated, “For the purposes of data and privacy protections, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be the Libra Association’s privacy regulator.” However, as reported by news outlet CNBC, Hugo Wyler, Head of Communication at the FDPIC, responded that there hasn’t been any communication between Facebook and the agency. He said, “We have taken note of the statements made by David Marcus, Chief of Calibra, on our potential role as data protection supervisory authority in the Libra context. Until today we have not been contacted by the promoters of Libra.” The agency official added that such communication is still anticipated, as there won’t be any compliance if they don’t understand the project. So far, this hearing has shown that Facebook has a long way to go if it plans on getting approval from Congress. It’s still early days but it looks more unlikely that the regulators would greenlight Libra.",

        "passage": "Only one of the “big four” cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea managed to record a profit for the year 2018. This revelation is the latest in a long list of negative performance for companies in the crypto space after the year-long bear market of 2018. Throughout 2018, cryptocurrency prices slumped considerably, by as much as 80 percent across the board.  According to Business Korea, only Upbit among the big four cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea posted profit earnings for 2018. The other three platforms – Coinone, Korbit, and as previously reported by Blockonomi, Bithumb, all recorded losses in 2018. Financial disclosure documents published by Dunamu Inc., operators of Upbit, show the platform was able to make a net profit of 140 billion won ($123 million). The cryptocurrency exchange posted sales of 470 billion won ($413 million) with an operating profit of more than 287 billion won ($252 million). Upbit’s operating expenses for the year stood at 96.5 billion won ($84 million). In all, the company performed better than it did in 2107 with its profit margin rising by almost 100 percent. For the other three, the situation was the exact opposite. Coinone’s audit report shows the company’s net loss at 5.80 billion won ($5 million). Korbit’s net loss for 2018 was about 45.80 billion won ($40 million). Bithumb posted the biggest losses among the big four, with a net loss of 205 billion won ($180 million). The platform’s net loss was more than Korbit and Coinone combined. There is also the possibility that the $30 million hack suffered by Bithumb also contributed to the size of its loss. Less than a fortnight after the hack, the company did announce that it had managed to recover more than half of the stolen cryptocurrencies. Despite the bear market of 2018, the Kimchi premium still persisted for large swaths of the year. Traders in the country often had to pay a markup price for cryptocurrencies when compared to the market average price. However, not even the Kimchi premium was enough to prevent the huge losses incurred by these three platforms. For all three, sales figures declined massively in the second half of the year. The significant sales decline coupled with the devaluation of cryptocurrency prices as the bear market bit harder saw operating profits for these platforms begin to enter deficit region. Tightening government regulations also likely played a role in the poor sales figures for these major exchange platforms. The government outlawed anonymous cryptocurrency trading with probably led to a decline in the number of accounts for each exchange. Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone aren’t alone in counting the losses from the year-long bear market of 2018. Mining firms also shrinking revenue with a couple even abandoning plans for massive initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong. Bitmain is yet to release its financial report for the second half of 2018. There are reports that the company suffered devastating losses in Q3 and Q4 2018. Bitmain’s bet on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the subsequent hash war of November 2018 are likely to have caused massive hemorrhage in the company’s revenue. Nvidia, one of the world’s largest computer chip maker announced earlier in the year that it was departing the cryptocurrency business. The company hopes to offload its outstanding inventory given the shrinking demand for mining hardware.",

        "passage": "A hacker was able to get his hands on roughly $1 million in cryptocurrency by using a San Francisco resident’s cell phone number. Robert Ross, a father of two, says that his phone suddenly lost its connection on October 26, 2018. Confused by the matter, he went to a nearby Apple store to see what the problem was and later spoke with his service provider AT&T. By the time the issue had been resolved, however, roughly $500,000 had already been lifted from two of Ross’ cryptocurrency accounts – one with Coinbase, the other with Gemini, and the hacker wasn’t ready to stop.  21-year-old Nicholas Truglia is the suspected attacker, who in all managed to walk off with approximately $1 million of Ross’ crypto funds. A felony complaint was filed in November in a California state court. Prosecutors are now saying that Truglia had been collecting phone numbers for some time – primarily of Silicon Valley executives – but had been unsuccessful in robbing their accounts. Erin West – deputy district attorney of Santa Clara County (where Ross lives) – comments: Truglia has been charged with roughly 21 counts including identity theft, attempted grand theft, fraud, crimes that “involve a pattern of related felony conduct” and even embezzlement. Ross had been accumulating the money for many years, hoping to have enough for his daughters’ college funds by the time they reached 18. The money was initially stored in USD on the crypto exchanges. Truglia later converted the money into digital assets and was able to move it into his own accounts before Ross could regain control of his cell phone.  The Accused Nicholas Truglia, Image from Finance Magnates After getting a warrant, officials searched Truglia’s high-rise apartment in Manhattan last week. While they were able to recover approximately $300,000 of the stolen funds, they claim that the rest of the money may be difficult to locate. Discussing the blockchain, West believes it’s something of a mixed bag, commenting: Truglia was able to target other victims during his crimewave including Saswata Basu, the CEO of blockchain storage service 0Chain; Gabrielle Katsnelson, the co-founder of SMBX, and Myles Danielson, a hedge fund executive. Truglia has agreed to extradition, and Santa Clara officials are scheduled to pick him up in December. A trial date will be set soon after. This isn’t the first case of a hacker hijacking a person’s phone to get their hands on crypto. Several cases have occurred in recent months through a relatively new tactic known as SIM swapping. A hacker targets a person and gathers information about them for several days. Once they have data regarding account passwords and security questions, they call the person’s cell phone provider and request that their number be transferred to a different SIM card. After a few probing questions (to which they typically have all the answers), the number is switched over to a card controlled by the hacker. They can then use the phone number to access the person’s personal (in this case, crypto) accounts. The most recent high-profile case of SIM swapping occurred in California last summer when a man sued AT&T for a record $224 million after the company allegedly failed to initiate appropriate security measures that allowed hackers to gain control of his SIM card and steal money from his crypto holdings.",

        "passage": "It appears Americans are losing faith in cryptocurrencies, and trust in the space is at an all-time low. A new survey suggests that approximately 41 percent of Americans – nearly half – will never invest in digital money.  One of the major problems with bitcoin and its altcoins cousins is volatility. Prices can swing up just as easily as they can swing down, and over the last two weeks, most investors have witnessed this firsthand. Bitcoin, for example, had risen to approximately $8,200 by mid-July, giving many enthusiasts cause for celebration. It was only a week later that things began to move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin began dropping quickly, and before long, all the July progress it had made was wiped from the slate. At press time, the currency is trading for roughly $6,300 – about $2,000 less than where less than half-a-month ago. From there, many altcoins began following in the currency’s footsteps. When bitcoin falls, others usually fall with it, and this time around was no exception. Ethereum – the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the number one competitor to bitcoin – is now trading at roughly $353. This is about $50 less than where it stood just last week, which in turn, was roughly $100 less than the position it held in mid-July. Ripple, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, is down by 16 percent, while Litecoin, the seventh-largest crypto by market cap, has fallen by more than nine percent.  Read: Bitcoin Price Falls Drastically After Bitcoin ETF Decision is Postponed Naturally, this takes a toll on investors’ outlooks, and cryptocurrency is losing the respect and attention it held during last year’s December rally. A poll conducted by the cryptocurrency app Gem and analytics firm Harris Insights recorded the answers of approximately 2,000 American adults. Of the individuals surveyed, only eight percent claimed to hold cryptocurrencies in their investment portfolios. It appears cryptocurrency still isn’t as popular as traditional stock options, which are held by approximately 52 percent of American adults according to a Gallup poll from 2016. In addition, those who did not hold crypto admit that they are simply not interested, and that nothing could ever “motivate them to invest in digital assets.” It’s a disappointing outcome, considering all bitcoin enthusiasts want is for the currency to hit mainstream territory. With such an anti-crypto attitude so present throughout the country, this dream appears considerably harder to accomplish. A separate Wells Fargo survey suggests even bleaker results. The study says that only two percent of Americans are invested in bitcoin or some other form of cryptocurrency, while 26 percent say they are intrigued by digital money, but have no plans of investing in it anytime soon. A whopping 70+ percent say that bitcoin is “too risky,” and that they would never invest in it. Hence, the goal of long-term, mainstream acceptance is pushed even further away. The surveys do point out some interesting signs. For example, Americans earning a minimum of $100,000 per year are far more likely to invest in crypto, while young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are more intrigued by cryptocurrencies than older citizens and are likely to invest in digital tokens regardless of their salaries.

        "passage": "Cryptocurrency is far from being the crowd pleaser, which explains why governments have taken regulatory strides to prohibit dealings with digital assets. While some countries have embraced the disruption that comes with virtual currencies, others are still on the adverse side of the technology. For Australia, however, the situation is ironic. The country was first crypto-friendly before anything else, doing as well as legalizing cryptocurrencies as a property in 2017.  Crypto exchanges were allowed to operate as long as they were registered under AUSTRAC, the country’s financial intelligence agency. Sadly, with the alarming rise of crypto-crimes in Australia, scammers are fueling the resolve of other anti-crypto countries to stand against cryptocurrencies and everything they represent. Crypto crimes like hacks and scams are not uncommon news in the cryptosphere, but it does begin to raise some brows when incessant news of said crimes come from one particular country. A report released by the ABC yesterday revealed that an Australian couple had lost over AU$20,000 (US$14,000) in a bitcoin scam, and that straw may as well have broken the proverbial camel’s back. Per the report, Nick and Josie Yeomans invested in a trading scheme that they discovered on Facebook, reportedly dubbed Coinexx.org (a name similar to Coinexx.com). The couple received a good return on their investment, enough to have them draw out funds to invest more – at which point the purported firm clamped down on the funds and even taunted the couple in a WhatsApp message. The Yeomans may be Australia’s latest victims, but they probably won’t be the last. In April, the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission revealed that cryptocurrency scams went up by 190% from the previous year, a wave that made Australian crypto users lose a total of $6.1 million Australian dollars ($4.3 million). Most of the victims were reined in with promises of forex trading access, commodity trading and other investment opportunities in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. Of the said 6.1 million AUD, a total of 2.6 million AUD was lost this way. Following this occurrence, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) made swift checks against suspicious websites and soon issued a warning to the Australian crypto community to steer clear of an alleged dubious entity dealing under two names, Dartalon Ltd and GFC Investments. The ASIC had released similar warnings previously, against suspicious Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and crypto-asset funds targeted at retail investors. The watchdog even stopped five different ICOs from raising capital since April 2018, claiming that they did not meet security standards required to run such businesses. ASIC followed by setting up MoneySmart – a website that investors could use for educating themselves on various financial matters before investing in ICOs. When crypto crimes happen, outsiders are quick to recommend that the affected bodies should take preventive measures rather than corrective ones. However, with Australia’s regulations and security provisions, both for retail investors and cryptocurrency exchanges, it is hard to apportion blame and responsibility. The growth of crypto crimes has since forced the Australian government to revise their stance towards cryptocurrency. In a June 20 article issued by the country’s Central Bank, it was declared that bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies would not be allowed as mainstream payments. “At the Australian level, there is definitely legitimate use for investment in cryptocurrencies, but we’re also seeing the use of them to facilitate tax crimes,” ATO deputy commissioner, Will Day had commented at the time. It is impossible to weigh the full impact of this restriction presently, but one thing is certain – if a previously crypto-friendly country like Australia draws back on their crypto relations, it may be harder for other crypto-averse countries to change their minds about the digital assets, seeing as their worst fears about them are coming true. In the long run, this cannot be good for the growth of the crypto sector globally.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin developers Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra, and Sanket Kanjalkar have created a new programming language that can help bitcoin transactions become more versatile. Announced on August 19th to the [bitcoin-dev] mailing list, Miniscript relies on the simple smart contract language already usable in Bitcoin, Script, to extend the conditional possibilities around bitcoin payments through a mixture of hash locks, time locks, and signatures.  “It’s a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling analysis, composition, generic signing and more,” Wuille explained.  Wuille added that Miniscript was “designed for Bitcoin as it exists today,” and no consensus changes were necessary to use it. The developers said they planned to “support future script changes Bitcoin may include” so as to evolve with the blockchain. Wuille later noted on Twitter that the new language could eventually be rolled into the Bitcoin Core repository if the Bitcoin community agreed to it. “I’ll work on incorporating parts of this in Bitcoin Core if that’s desired (I believe it could be very useful), but ideally it gets included in many pieces of wallet technology,” he said.  Notably, the developers created a so-called “policy compiler” for Miniscript. Among other things, the tool lets users get an idea for when conditional bitcoin transactions can be spent. Pieter Wuille and Andrew Poelstra are rockstar developers in the Bitcoin community (Sanket is an up-and-comer in his own right!). That’s not only because of what they’ve already built but also because the technology they’re still working on that could shape the future of Bitcoin for years to come. Some of that tech includes in-progress developments like Schnorr Signatures and Taproot. The former is an efficient algorithm for cryptographic signatures, and the latter would make bitcoin smart contract transactions private by making them appear like normal transactions. In the wake of revealing Miniscript on Monday, Wuille that the project wasn’t directly related to Taproot but did provide the participating developers with insights on how to improve the Script language itself, which could lead to wider implications later in the Bitcoin ecosystem: Another technology being worked on generally in the Bitcoin community is PSBTs, or partially-signed bitcoin transactions. Wuille also noted that the advancements made possible by the new scripting language could work in a complementary fashion with such transactions. “My hope is that Miniscript, together with things like PSBT can reduce some of the barriers between pieces of software,” he said.  One of the most esteemed coders in the entire cryptocurrency space has come aboard Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s bitcoin outfit. Square Crypto — the recently launched open-source bitcoin development arm of popular mainstream payments company Square — announced their hiring of Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo on August 20th. Corallo later confirmed his new employment on Twitter.  In being one of the world’s leading Bitcoin experts and builders, Corallo brings a veteran presence to the upstart development team that only hired its first employee, former Google product director Steve Lee, in June. The project comes as part of Jack Dorsey’s person mission to contribute to building out the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin,” Square CEO Dorsey had said in announcing Square Crypto back in the spring.",

According to news sources, both figures signed deals with a company known as Centra Tech, which reportedly sells financial products related to cryptocurrency. At press time, over $30 million has been invested into Centra Tech by various investors, who are now looking to reclaim their funds along with damages after the company’s founders Raymond Trapani, Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas were arrested and charged with both wire and securities fraud back in April of 2018. All three were allegedly found guilty of attempting to defraud their investors through an initial coin offering (ICO).  According to a press release detailing the events, the three cofounders: Robert Khuzami – the lawyer representing the victims – later claimed: All three cofounders are facing a minimum of five years in prison. Investors claim the value of the coin being offered through the ICO has dropped tremendously over the past six months, being valued at over $1 back in April and plummeting down to less than two cents at the time of this writing. Both Mayweather and Khaled took to social media last year to express their excitement over Centra Tech, with Mayweather even telling his followers that they could call him “Floyd Crypto Mayweather” from now on. Khaled commented that the company and its assorted products were “game changers.”  Read: Celebrities Shilling for Cryptocurrency: A Risky Investment Crypto scams appear to be running rampant. In a related story, analysts are working to track an alleged scammer who stole from as many as 10,000 individual Dogecoin investors. It is believed that the malicious individual garnered as much as $24,000 in crypto funds. The analysts investigating the situation stem from Russia-based cybersecurity firm Doctor Web, and explained in a statement: The analysts claim that the hacker uses assorted malware to steal confidential data, such as passcodes and usernames, from Dogecoin enthusiasts, which are then used to access accounts and steal funds. The operation involves a fake cryptocurrency exchange that is used to steal incoming deposits, and there’s also a fake Dogecoin mining pool and Dogecoin-mining browser extension. The hacker is also employing a phony lottery system that states users will win funds in ether tokens, though it’s reportedly rigged to only allow the hacker to win any money.

        "passage": "Coinbase, the United States’ most popular exchange, has temporarily halted support for Ethereum Classic transactions, deposits, and withdrawals due to a 51 percent attack on Sunday, reports CoinDesk. The attack was made public via The Coinbase Blog this Monday. There, security engineer Mark Nesbitt started the post with a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper: For any proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, the honest approval of half of the miners (nodes) is required to alter the blockchain – otherwise known as validating a transaction. Ideally, that half would always have an opinion that benefits the blockchain, but that isn’t always the case.  Should 51 percent of nodes be taken over, the system will fall under attack: According to the post, this process is called a “chain reorganization.” Each one has “depth” which means the number of blocks that were replaced. Then, it has a “length” which is how many blocks replaced the previous ones. What Ethereum Classic suffered from was this, resulting in what is called a “double-spend attack” – when a digital token is spent more than once. It is duplicated, in a sense. The value of this attack seems to be 88,500 ETC ($460,000) reads the Coinbase Blog. This was the result of over 100 blocks being “reorganized.” The information has been validated by Bitfly and Blockscout – block explorers monitoring the blockchain. Also, Coiness reported on one of their analysts finding an “abnormal hash rate” heading into one mining pool, which was the first sign of the attack. SlowMist, a security company from China, had made the attack public on Monday morning and revealed their attempts to track it. When discussing their next steps, Nesbitt ended the post with: No one can agree on the length of the attack, however. Blockscout reported reorganization at 02:00 UTC and 05:00 UTC this Monday. However, at 17:00 UTC, Bitfly stated that the attack could be ongoing, which the Coinbase post echoed. As revealed via CoinDesk, Blockscout project lead Andrew Cravenho claimed that the Ethereum Classic network is “fluctuating and people are always switching their hashing power.” Cravenho’s explanation isn’t universally accepted, however. In an e-mail to Coindesk, Ethereum Classic advisor Cody Burns believes the attack was more of a “selfish mining” put in place by a “client-local phenomenon.” Then, Burns tweeted that “the entire Ethereum network doesn’t ‘reorganize’ simultaneously. It would be more likely that someone discovered all of Coinbase ETC nodes and ‘surrounded’ them.” Regardless of the reasons behind the attack, companies working with Ethereum Classic should do whatever they can to protect their user base. The official Ethereum Classic Twitter account stated that the crypto mining hardware manufacturer Linzhi could be the culprit. Allegedly, the group was testing new machines with a 1,400mH/s hash rate. Yet, a director of operations Wolfgang Spraul claimed:",

        "passage": "A new report by CipherTrace says that hackers and other cybercriminals stole about $1.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018. The Menlo Park-based blockchain forensic analysis firm says this number represents a fivefold increase from 2017’s figures. In a new document titled “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2018 Q4,” CipherTrace revealed that “bad actors” successfully stole $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies from hacks and other elaborate scams. Out of this number, about $950 million came from cyberattacks on Bitcoin exchanges.  The remainder came from ICO exit scams, Ponzi schemes, mobile phone sim swaps, etc. Researchers at CipherTrace say these exit scams cost investors $750 million in 2018. Back in August 2018, data from blockchain analytics firm, Diar, revealed that five ICOs stole close to $100 million from unsuspecting investors. According to the report, cryptocurrency theft in 2018 increased by more than 400 percent. This surge occurred despite a year-long bear market for virtual currencies with prices falling by over 80 percent. The document also revealed the emergence of a new cyberthreat to the industry. This new wave of bad actors, according to the report comes from people working within firms in the market looking to exploit investors. Commenting on the matter, Dave Jevans, the company CEO, said: While cybercriminals may have increased their loot in 2018, CipherTrace says they will need to successfully launder their ill-gotten gains before newly enacted anti-money laundering (AML) regulations come into effect. An excerpt from the report reads: Concerning cryptocurrency exchange hacks, the report revealed that platforms in Japan and South Korea suffered the most. Indeed, 2018 began with the over $500 million hack of Tokyo-based Coincheck. Platforms like Bithumb and Zaif also fell victim to cryptocurrency hackers. In total, the report says hackers stole 3.6 times more than in 2017 and seven times more than in 2016. In response, places like South Korea and Japan have tried to firm up regulations to prevent such attacks. Apart from several policies enacted by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), regulators also gave green light from self-regulation. Outside Japan and South Korea, investors in Vietnam also lost about $35 million to the Sky Mining scam. In a related development, another new report, this time by Chainalysis revealed that most of cryptocurrency exchange hacks were the work of two syndicates. According to Chainalysis, two groups dubbed “Alpha” and “Beta” were responsible for more than 60 percent of all attacks against Bitcoin exchanges. Going by the report, it appears that crypto cybercrimes, at the least the ones targeted at exchange platforms might be the work of centralized syndicates. The report also alleged that both groups have different motives for their attacks. The Beta group is reportedly interested in getting rich from their loot. However, the Alpha group could have far more sinister motivations for their actions. Meanwhile, 2019 which is barely a month old has already registered its first cryptocurrency exchange hack. This time, New Zealand-based Cryptopia is the victim. According to reports, hackers stole more than $16 million in Ethereum tokens from the platform. A recent report by blockchain analysis firm, Elementus, the group responsible for the Cryptopia hack resumed their attack after a two-week dormancy period. The firm believes that Cryptopia no longer has access to its wallets meaning that the hackers can continue to siphon funds.",

Bitcoin Cash raised a surprising eleven percent but is still stuck under $200 as of this writing.  Earlier this week, Bitcoin hit its low of $3,456 – down a total of 82.2 percent from an all-time high of $19,500. On top of this, Ethereum’s value fell out of the hundreds, with the last time this happened back in the summer of 2017. On Sunday, Alex Krüger, a cryptocurrency analyst claimed this the lowest price of the year, as reported by CCN. However, he also believes it’s too early to say if this drop is short or long term: However, Ethereum bounced back in the hundreds the next day, hitting $113 up from $98 – a seven percent increase. Bitcoin went up six percent, and Ripple saw an eight percent increase as well. Interestingly, even as Bitcoin’s price fell, the overall volume of Satoshi’s cryptocurrency stayed within $5 to $6 million. Then, as it went back up above $4,000, that number reached $6.7 billion thanks to buy orders. Another analyst, Don Alt, asserted that Sunday’s crash was the fastest decline he had seen “in recent years.” Yet, Alt remains positive in that a recovery will likely happen sooner rather than later. Even with that, he says to be prepared in case of another crash. A new yearly low could hit at $2,950 – totaling an eighty-five percent drop from Bitcoin’s all-time high: However, we have to take our small victories where we can get them. Earlier today, The Next Web reported that Ohio would be the first U.S. state to accept Bitcoin for tax payments. Going into effect this week, business owners can pay their taxes on OhioCrypto.com. The website accepts twenty-three different forms of taxes, with the full list available here: We can thank Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel for this change. He believes that crypto will “make things easier for tax-payers but also establish Ohio’s status as a cryptocurrency trailblazer.” Mandel isn’t sure how many businesses will jump onto this initiative right away, but the treasurer is “confident that this cryptocurrency initiative will continue.” According to the website, all payments will be processed by BitPay. Eventually, this service will be open to people instead of just businesses. However, this marks the first time governments “have considered accepting payments in cryptocurrency,” says The Next Web. This account comes after a San Francisco judge had a criminal pay his bail in Bitcoin, but was later revoked as courts couldn’t figure out how it should work.",

        "passage": "HSBC India has completed a first of its kind blockchain enable transaction in partnership with ING Bank Brussels between Indian Holding juggernaut Reliance Industries (RIL) and its client in the U.S., according to reports by local Indian newspaper The Hindu Business Line. The transaction was in the form of a blockchain enabled Letter of Credit (LoC), necessitated by the shipment sent out from Reliance Industries to U.S energy company Tricon Energy, leading to a substantial reduction in the cost and time of processing documents.  Based on the report, the issuing bank for the LoC was ING Bank, while HSBC India, advised and negotiated on behalf of Reliance Industries. R3’s Corda platform facilitated the end-to-end transaction. The news outlet believes the new system is an improvement to how partners interact regarding exports in India, as it brings both parties together on one platform. The traditional way of facilitating such a transaction includes sending physical copies of LoCs to each party in the transaction. The Hindu Business Line quoted HSBC India in a statement stating: The bank went further to state: Hitendra Dave, Head-Global Banking and Markets, HSBC India was also quoted by the news outlet, where he hailed the use of blockchain for trade as it “enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster.” The new solution was implemented in line with the integration of an Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) called Bolero. Combining the features of a legal framework and technology, this eBL “replicates the core elements of a traditional paper bill of lading.” Bolero was introduced in November 2016 as a platform where trading partners can introduce documents, allowing them to settle international trade faster and improve the cycle.  The eBL allows “carriers and logistics providers the ability to create, send, amend and manage bills of lading digitally with greater accuracy, integrity, and speed. This reduces the likelihood of any potential fraud, errors and the cost of administration,” according to Bolero’s website.  At the time of the launch, the Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance for HSBC India had stated the importance of Bolero for cross-border trade.  “This first step we’ve taken with e-Presentation has big implications for companies in India and elsewhere. It shows that the participants in cross-border trade – from producers to banks and shippers – are willing to collaborate to achieve an end-to-end digital transaction. It also shows that collaboration is worthwhile, optimizing companies’ working capital so they can move on to their next deal sooner.” Other companies that have been trialing the use of blockchain as a substitute for traditional trade documents include BBVA, which use a platform created by Wave to cut down on their transaction time from seven to 10 days to less than 3 hours. The transaction involved was the exportation of more than 25 tons of frozen tuna from Pinsa Congelados, of Mazatlan, México. Payments were made by a BBVA issued LoC and processed by Bancomer in Mexico. Patxi Fernández de Trocóniz, head of global trade & international banking, BBVA, had stated at the time: “The pilot we carried out with Wave represents a leap forward in improving the efficiency of international trade transactions. The time it takes to manage the documentation was reduced to a process that lasted just a few hours, in which all parties – the banks, the importer and the exporter – were constantly aware of the status of the documents.”",

        "passage": "Blockchain, the hugely famous start-up company, not the ledger architecture, is suing a company in US court. They claim that a seemingly abandoned company has created a web-presence that emulated their own, and is on the cusp of launching an ICO. The mostly unregulated nature of the crypto market makes these kinds of issues nearly unavoidable, but it looks like the US court system is beginning to take the crypto world seriously. It is ironic that Blockchain would be targeted by scammers, as they have stated that their goal is to help the crypto community to root-out scams. The potentially crooked company on the other end of the lawsuit is the apparently abandoned “Paymium”, which was thought to be long relegated to Bitcoin history.  Paymium was at the center of a crypto controversy dating back to 2013. The company claimed to the the victim of a hack, wherein numerous clients and creditors lost substantial amounts of their cryptos. Their “Instawallet” service ended up being a full-on debacle, and the company seemingly went out of business after they suspended their claiming service. Fast-forward to last week, when Blockchain filed suit against whoever is at the helm of Paymium in US federal court. For now the details are scant, but a recent move by a New York court could land whoever is running Paymium in some very hot water. A case in New York could be setting some heavy precedents for ICO scammers. The judge in a case being brought against Protostarr ICO decided that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could move legally against potentially fraudulent ICO. Lawyers for Maksim Zaslavskiy had argued that because US securities law is vague, ICOs were outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction. Maksim Zaslavskiy was connected to numerous crypto companies, including RECoin and PlexiCoin ICO. These cases might sound obscure, but they could have widespread consequences. Blockchain is registered in Luxembourg, but they chose to sue Paymium in US courts. The SEC oversees one of the largest financial systems in the world, and if they decide to go after a violator, the US has law enforcement treaties with numerous nations. It appears that the US has decided at a (potentially federal) judicial level that tokens are considered securities, and fall under the jurisdiction of US regulators. The crypto markets have been largely under the collective radar of both law enforcement and regulators since their inception, but that looks like it is changing. Apparently Maksim Zaslavskiy made the specific argument that tokens can’t be considered securities. Now that a New York court has found the contrary to be true, the weight of the precedent is difficult to overstate. It would be fair to assume that if anyone wanted to allege wrongdoing in an ICO, they will be able to do so in New York’s courts. A study prepared by Statis Group that was released earlier this year estimated that more than 80% of the ICOs from 2017 were fraudulent to some degree. Thankfully the money that was raised by ICOs last year wasn’t distributed equally. Of the roughly $12 billion USD that flowed into ICOs in 2017, Statis estimated that more than $1.3 billion USD found its way to ICOs that looked like outright scams. Not that it looks like US courts are allowing tokens to be considered a security for purposes of prosecution, the hunt could be on for an major ICO scam to make an example of. In most cases financial crime isn’t prosecuted with this same vigor as violent crime, but with cryptos, this may not be the case. To be clear, there has been no new law, just a clarification of existing regulations. Because the regulations that are being used to prosecute Maksim Zaslavskiy were in effect last year, fraudulent ICOs have little legal room to maneuver. With all the jilted ICO investors who must be out there, this isn’t great news from the perspective of the dishonest people who thought they could get away with hundreds of millions of dollars without any consequences.",

The new service features real-time spot prices for several cryptocurrencies, which according to Bitmain, will be updated every second of each day. This means that the slightest change will be recorded to ensure customers are always in the know. Second, there is a reference price published at approximately 10 a.m. in Hong Kong every day. The index will also feature the spot prices of the industry’s top 17 cryptocurrencies. Aside from this fund, Bitmain has also announced plans to launch the Crypto Large Cap 10 Index (BLC 10). Executives claim that this index will track baskets of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Customers can also look forward to updates every second through this platform. In a press release, Bitmain explains: November has been something of a mixed month for Bitmain, and the company has seen its fair share of controversy over the past 30 days. Early in the month, Bitmain filed suit against an anonymous hacker that executives claimed had stolen approximately $5.5 million from the company’s cryptocurrency wallets. Court documents allege that the hacker ultimately gained access to the company’s digital wallets and moved crypto funds to his own personal accounts, later selling them at above market prices and garnering a hefty fortune. The suit was filed in a U.S. district court in Washington. Prosecutors allege that the hacker knowingly behaved in a way that ultimately wronged and injured Bitmain’s business operations. However, the company was later slapped with a class-action suit from approximately 100+ customers who had bought Bitmain’s assorted crypto miners. The plaintiffs alleged that the company had secretly set up the miners to extract new cryptocurrency units and move them into the company’s own crypto wallet accounts by default. The setup and configuration processes for Bitmain’s miners are reported to take anywhere between several hours to several days to complete, which potentially gave Bitmain a huge window to mine cryptocurrency unnoticed. The plaintiffs are suing the company for over $5 million to cover their electricity costs and legal fees. The court filing for the case reads: Bitmain isn’t the only company that has sought to create a benchmark price for cryptocurrencies. The Finance Magnates Intelligence Department has also worked to develop a cryptocurrency performance benchmark, which allegedly measures the present conditions of the main cryptocurrency markets. The platform consists of the four largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (bitcoin, ether, XRP and bitcoin cash) and consistently tracks their price changes, giving readers updated information on their favorite coins regularly and throughout the day. In September of 2017, the benchmark boasted an initial value of roughly 5,000 points.",

        "passage": "Terrorists. Cryptocurrency haters have been using the excuse of terrorists for years now. They argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with privacy features, will inevitably be used to fund terrorism and launder money. Is there any truth to this claim? Are terrorist groups using crypto to fund their operations? According to a report by the nonprofit RAND Corp., the group famous for producing research documents for the US military, terrorists are not generally using crypto. The reason? Crypto just isn’t widely accepted enough.  While crypto bashers love to cite terrorism as a reason for putting a leash on cryptocurrency, there is some degree of truth to this concern. Terrorism is real. These groups need funding in order to bankroll their operations. For instance, the report states that terrorist groups need money to “purchase of weapons, payrolls, supporting attacks, and other operational activities.” Traditionally, terrorists have funded their operations through black-market activities such as making and selling drugs, human trafficking, and a plethora of other deplorable practices. This money then needs to be laundered and moved around the globe securely. This need presents a serious problem. The international banking system has safeguards in place to restrict this type of activity. While there are ways to get around these restrictions, the potential for the nefarious use of cryptocurrency is definitely there. With cryptocurrency offering instantaneous anonymous global transfers of value with no potential for interference from governments or banks, shouldn’t terrorists be flocking to crypto? Apparently, they aren’t. According to the report titled Terrorist Use of Cryptocurrencies released by RAND Corp., cryptocurrencies are simply too undeveloped to be of much use to terrorists. One issue is that cryptocurrencies are still not very widely accepted. This means if a terrorist is sitting on a pile of any given cryptocurrency, it’s not particularly easy to directly spend those coins or tokens for the supplies or services they need. Compared to the iconic briefcase full of cash, an electronic wallet full of crypto is just not as versatile for terrorists. The report describes this issue as follows: A lack of ATMs isn’t the only hurdle, either. The report also stated that: “Generally…the conditions needed to allow terrorist groups to establish themselves and flourish…might make the technological infrastructure needed for cryptocurrencies infeasible.” In other words, limited access to the internet or wallet devices could be a problem. The small size of cryptocurrency markets (in comparison to traditional markets) also hinders the ability of terrorists to hide their activities. According to the report: “Large transactions have impacts on price; demand increases are reflected in publicly visible prices, making the transaction non-anonymous.” Black-market activities can be big business. Terrorist groups can put together millions of dollars from their illicit activities. Such large amounts of money are simply too difficult or nearly impossible to hide on low-volume markets. This is particularly true for smaller privacy cryptocurrencies like Monero, which the RAND report mentions specifically. One obvious concern that can be drawn from the report is that the restrictions facing terrorists today could become moot in the coming years. If cryptocurrencies continue to see greater adoption, then the need to have a direct link to fiat currencies through an exchange may become unnecessary. If terrorists are able to engage in high-volume transactions among each other directly using privacy-centric cryptocurrencies, then their need for money laundering and transmission services will essentially be met. This kind of acceptance will also preclude the need for services like bitcoin ATMs because again a fiat link would be mostly unnecessary. Further, the type of failed states where terrorism flourishes could see greater connectivity to the Internet as technology develops, even if regional infrastructure is mostly nonexistent. For example, mobile wallets connected through satellite connections could easily provide the needed connectivity to conduct cryptocurrency transactions anywhere on the face of the planet, even in the middle of the ocean on top of a dilapidated black-market freighter. The issue of terrorists using cryptocurrency is in some ways a red herring. Any group that is bent on causing violence, fear, and mayhem will likely find a way to do so regardless of convenient monetary tools. Terrorism is still an issue today, despite decades of harsh bank and government imposed controls. Clearly, the terrorists have found ways to fund their goals already. If they adopt crypto en masse, will that make any difference?",

        "passage": "For the most part, investors abiding by traditional investment strategies have avoided Bitcoin like the plague. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, for instance, called the cryptocurrency “rat poison squared”, later explaining that there isn’t much inherent value in the project. But, there is a rapidly-growing narrative that the need for Bitcoin is growing as the current tumultuous macroeconomic and geopolitical climate is perfect for the industry’s growth. And the chief executive of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, perpetuated said narrative on CNBC on Monday.  Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear over the past week. According to analytics site Coin360, the asset is up around 22% in the past seven days. As of the time of writing this article, the flagship cryptocurrency sits snug at $11,700 — down $2,300 from the year-to-date top, but $2,600 up from the monthly bottom. According to Allaire, who appeared on CNBC’s now seemingly crypto-centric “Squawk Box” segment, this rally has much to do with what is going on in terms of turmoil on the geopolitical stage. He stated: Indeed, Bitcoin began its latest rally around two days ago in direct correlation with a tweet that Donald Trump published in regards to fresh tariffs, which also coincided with a drop in the value of the Chinese Yuan against the U.S. Dollar. This is the seeming second time that tariff-related messages from the Trump administration have resulted in a drop in the CNY/USD and a rally in BTC. This move supports the hearsay that Chinese investors who have managed to skirt regulations are buying Bitcoin to get money out of an increasingly threatened economy. Trade wars aren’t the end of the story. Allaire continued: He isn’t the first to have thought this. Tyler Cowen, a Bloomberg economist-columnist that formerly was a clear skeptic of Bitcoin, recently admitted that the cryptocurrency likely has a big future. One of the four reasons he mentioned in his op-ed was the fact that rising levels of populism around the world will likely force prudent investors to look for safe havens/hedges suitable for our day and age — this being an alternative, uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin. All this corroborates the theories that Bitcoin is the successor to gold. As  Chamath Palihapitiya, a former executive of Facebook and venture capitalist, told CNBC viewers a few weeks back: Allaire concluded his segment by discussing his opinion that the Chinese government is softening their blows against the industry. To back this point, the chief executive suggested that the rulings of certain Chinese courts, like the Hangzhou Internet Court’s admission that Bitcoin is “digital property”, and certain statements of support from large technologists and entire commercial banks is a sign that Bitcoin is becoming an accepted industry in China once again.",

        "passage": "The stablecoin revolution continues to grow stronger, and Binance has made another move to strengthen its position in the market. The Malta-based exchange Binance, which is the second largest cryptocurrency exchange platform by trade volume, according to CoinMarketCap, recently announced that it would be providing USD Coin (USDC), the USD-pegged stablecoin from crypto firm Circle, according to a blog post published on November 15, 2018. The exchange also noted that they would be offering deposits immediately.  USDC, which was announced back in May 2018 by Circle and was subsequently released in September, is one of the fast-rising stablecoins in the industry that has seen its stock go through the roof since Tether lost its peg last month. Binance joins a host of other major digital asset platforms to have listed USDC, with Coinbase making a similar move at the end of last month. In its statement today, Binance added, “For increased transparency, USDC has engaged a top-ranking auditing firm to release monthly balance attestations of the corresponding USDC and USD balances held/issued.” The exchange also noted that it would provide options for USDC/BNB and USDC/BTC from November 17, 2018. Fiat-backed stablecoins have been receiving an increasing amount of support from exchanges all over the world, particularly with the uncertainty with Tether and the constant volatility of Bitcoin. Last month, digital asset platforms Huobi and OKEx opted to list four of these USD-backed stablecoins at once. The exchanges listed TrueUSD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). Binance, which added support for PAX in September, has been a big admirer of stablecoins for a while. After adding the Paxos Standard Token, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that he hoped more of these stablecoins would surface.  Read: What are Stablecoins? At the time, Zhao had given a vote of confidence on stablecoins, tweeting: Two months after, Binance added support for coins such as Ravencoin (RNV) and Decred (DCR), to name a few. In the few months since Circle launched USDC, the stablecoin has continued to wax stronger, bolstered by the increasing amount of support and adoption that it has gotten all over the crypto landscape. It is currently available on exchanges that represent tens of billions of dollars in trading volume. USDC has a current supply of over $148 million, with dozens of digital asset platforms currently supporting it. Binance’s move to add support for USDC won’t surprise many in the market, as the digital asset platform is committed to making positive business moves that will shore up its revenue streams while providing trading options for its customers. Speaking with CNBC in an interview, Zhao said that the company was not concerned by the reduction in trading volume that was caused by the slump, adding that this slump signaled nothing more than a “stability period.” He also said that the company is still signing new users up at an accelerated rate, even though the current level doesn’t math up to what it was in January. Zhao argued that the decrease in the trading volume is a precursor to stabilization in prices, and when people trade less, they most likely end up shifting their cons to their wallets. However, with Binance, the opposite seems to be the case. “When we see an increase in BTC holdings over time, it usually means that people are not moving their BTC to us,” Zhao explained. Binance CEO went on to add that he expects to see an entrance of institutions into the industry as they will ostensibly provide a wide range of regulated- and more stable- coins.",

It was announced in a press release provided by Vostok on Mar. 14th, that Waves platform will be organizing another round of private funding for their blockchain enterprise solution with investors from Southeast Asia, China, and Europe already participating in funding the project.  The project was introduced back in 2018 with the first funding round that brought $ 120 million to the prominent blockchain enterprise solution in addition to having its patron, Waves, predicting another round of $ 120 million, which would also raise the presently estimated market capitalization to $ 1.2 billion. Introducing the community to Vostok back on Apr. 12th, Waves presented their most recent project as a part of Waves ecosystem, created to allow implementation of Waves technology across enterprise and government IT systems, initially describing Vostok as an attempt to build and develop a blockchain-based layer for decentralized Web, popularly called Web 3.0. During the same year, on Oct. 23rd, Waves representatives shared the news on Medium on the matter of setting a new record for the maximum number of daily transactions on the ledger, that way beating XRP, EOS and ETH with over 6.1 million transactions processed in the course of 24 hours, which provided Waves with benevolent status among similar blockchain projects. While Waves is working on technology that could facilitate the development of decentralized Web, Vostok plays an important role in this case scenario as the project should help Waves build the foundation for the “digital future” of next generation. The project was tested by numerous global organizations, including the famous Sberbank, since it was first announced in April 2018, while Dolfin, an investment group based in London, is set to coordinate the second funding round deal. The first funding round that was held in December 2018 for private investors secured the project’s second round only several months later, set to sell 10% of the future issue of VST, as the project previously received valuation of 600 million dollars after the second round where 20% of the future issue of VST units were distributed to institutional and private investors. The distribution was set in accordance with potential benefits that institutional and private investors are set to bring to the project development. The second funding round should end on May 31st, 2019, while the team behind Waves platform expects to see 100 million VST units sold within the private sale, which should create a capital of 1.2 billion dollars. In the meanwhile, the founder and CEO of Waves platform, Sasha Ivanov, is hoping to see the second round opening “opportunities to enter new markets”, among other things. The CEO explained that Vostok represents a private blockchain that combines technology and solutions previously tested for building the international blockchain platform, Waves, which includes innovations of digital technology such as Big Data, industrial Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. According to the CEO of Dolfin, a London-based investment group, the main objective of the project at the present is to attract institutional investors alongside capital ventures and mutual funds, which would ultimately boost the interest in Vostok. Vostok project is already making a commotion in the market ahead of the second funding round, as according to the initial press release, representatives are already in the midst of negotiations for setting up the first projects backed by Vostok in China, Europe, and Southeast Asia.",

CoinCola already allows their clients to trade fiat currency for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, USDT and Dash, so  XRP will make a welcome addition to an already robust set of options. Over The Counter (OTC) trading offers substantial benefits for CoinCola’s customers, and many large institutions use the same framework due to its efficiency and speed. Instead of dealing with a market-maker, traders and investors are able to trade directly and save money on trading fees.  CoinCola has been an active player in crypto trading and has created a platform that helps to keep trading costs low. The addition of XRP to their line-up of cryptos only adds to an already robust offering of trading options. This year has been rough for the reputation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Last year saw billions raised with ICOs, but today many are known to be outright scams. CoinCola offers its users the safety of escrow for their trades and purchases, so they get the assets they are paying for. CoinCola offers its clients the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, USDT, Dash and Ripple. Their platform also allows the direct purchase of cryptos with their local fiat currency. Regardless of whether a clients goal is a short-term trade or investment, CoinCola’s mobile-app enabled platform is worth considering. XRP started off 2018 with a bang. As the year progressed, XRP was neck and neck with ETH as the second largest crypto by total market value . Over the last month, it overtook ETH on a sustained basis, and today is second only to BTC in terms of market cap. Unlike other cryptos, which weren’t designed with a specific market in mind, Ripple was developed to make international transactions a breeze. The company has been successful in cementing agreements with major banks, including some of Japan’s largest banks. The Chief Market Strategist at Ripple, Cory Johnson, recently told the Techonomy 2018 conference that, The fact that a ‘crypto company’ has attracted so many paying clients is probably a plus for their long-term survivability, and CoinCola has recognized how important XRP could be going forward. One of the reasons why institutional investors prefer to use OTC markets is their lower fee structure. Because the exchange is only ensuring that both parties are on the up-and-up, the fees for an OTC transaction tend to be far lower than an on-exchange purchase.  CoinCola’s OTC exchange certainly delivers price-efficiency and allows crypto users of all sizes to take advantage of an OTC trading architecture. CoinCola offers free deposits for their customers. For people that want to use as market-maker , CoinCola offers trading pair as well. XRP will be the newest coin to join the list of majors already available at CoinCola, so traders have the ability to access the second-most valuable crypto issuance in the world.",

        "passage": "This weekend, the world’s central bankers descended on a small town in Wyoming, Jackson Hole, to talk policy — monetary policy. While the conversations were centered around fiat monies, crypto — or “digital assets” at least — became a topic of discussion when the Bank of England’s governor brought up the matter. It’s crazy to think that a mere ten years after Bitcoin was birthed, some of the most powerful individuals on Earth are seriously discussing cryptocurrency.  Speaking in front of a group of central bankers on Friday at the Economic Policy Symposium, Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, took some time to discuss the future of finance. He argued that the world is in need of an entirely new monetary and financial system, citing his sentiment that the U.S. Dollar-based system that exists today is somewhat archaic. In fact, Reuters reports that Carney said the USD is currently playing a “destabilizing” role in the world economy, citing the effects of globalization and trade spats. He added that with the dollar being the de-facto reserve asset of the world, with USD being a primary settlement tool for international trade and central banks hoarding the currency, “developments in the U.S. economy, by affecting the dollar exchange rate, can have large spillover effects to the rest of the world.” Carney then brought up potential alternatives to the USD, namely a “synthetic hegemonic currency” that would exist through a digital asset model. He claims that such a crypto asset would decrease the dollar’s dominance, as it would be backed by multiple fiat currencies and accepted by global partners. Talk around such a currency naturally led the Bank of England chief to Libra, which he claims is an “intriguing” concept. Carney asserted that Libra likely doesn’t have the potential to succeed, citing regulatory concerns. Indeed, ever since the project was formally unveiled in June, governments the world over have been scrutinizing the product, claiming that it will propagate crime and global financial instability should it launch. And, of course, members of the Libra Association are looking to pull out of their agreement with Facebook. Many believe that a global cryptocurrency — be it Libra or something less corporate — will only be a boon for the adoption and price of Bitcoin. Raoul Pal, the former head of Goldman Sachs’s hedge funds sales division and the chief executive of Real Vision, the implementation of a new monetary system is likely to be a boon for Bitcoin.  In a sub-tweet, Pal further explained his thoughts, responding “exactly” to a comment claiming that a widely-adopted fiat digital asset will act as an on-ramp for the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the wide adoption of a digital form of money will acclimate society to transition to Bitcoin and decentralized solutions, especially if governments are encroaching on the privacy and safety of citizens. While there is a talk about a global fiat cryptocurrency, many nations have been going ahead with plans to digitize their local sovereign monies. Just recently, an official of the People’s Bank of China revealed to a group of Chinese bankers and economic pundits that it is prepared to launch a digital currency that is based on a blockchain-like system. While the official didn’t give a concrete date, China is likely aiming to make its digital currency available before Libra goes live.",

        "passage": "Venezuela has been in a disastrous state for several years. The country has fallen victim to mass inflation after its native currency, the bolivar, was deemed relatively worthless by the nation’s leading financial authorities. As a result, the prices of necessary survival goods such as food, clothing and water, have shot through the roof. Items like these are relatively inaccessible to many individuals who either don’t have the money or the resources to obtain what they need to keep their families up and healthy. In addition, many of these products are seemingly rare. It’s not improbable now to hear stories of citizens venturing into their local marketplaces to see all the shelves bare except for a single canned item that’s selling for a ridiculous price given the shortages the country is experiencing. We have often heard tales of residents killing zoo animals for food in a final and desperate attempt to survive. It’s an ugly picture, to say the least.  For many, the idea of cryptocurrency potentially easing the country’s financial troubles isn’t that far off, and to an extent, the nation has already ventured into this territory through its use of the petro. Introduced in early 2018, the currency is allegedly backed by the country’s many oil reserves, making it something of a “stable coin” in that oil will always be a necessary item for humanity’s ongoing survival. While not backed by fiat, oil is consistently proving itself as a much-needed resource, though the statement regarding the petro’s backing has led to controversy. No mention of the oil reserves occurs in the petro’s whitepaper, and many believe President Nicolas Maduro has embellished the currency’s abilities and uses. Due to the ongoing controversy, many exchanges do not feature petro trading on their platforms, and U.S. President Donald Trump has banned all petro trading in America. Some analysts now believe that the answer is not a separate cryptocurrency, but rather a cryptocurrency service; one that could potentially deliver financial aid to the people through cryptocurrency. The man taking this to heart is Steve Hanke, a hyperinflation expert and professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. He’s teaming up with Air TM in Mexico City and introducing a project entitled “Airdrop Venezuela.” The goal of the project is to garner roughly $1 million in cryptocurrency donation funds. That money will then be distributed to approximately 100,000 people via Air TM’s trading platform. Hanke states: It is believed that if Maduro were to tie the bolivar to the U.S. dollar, the inflation issue could be resolved in a relatively short time. Unfortunately, the Venezuelan president and his associates have failed to do so. Presently, inflation in Venezuela exceeds 116,000 percent. Hanke is confident that the project will demonstrate crypto’s ability to be used as a national, mainstream medium of exchange. He comments: If the experiment is successful, crypto could be used in everyday transactions, officiating its position as money and not just as a speculative investment tool. In addition, the successful distribution of the crypto donations could officially dollarize Venezuela, which could quickly stabilize the economy.",

        "passage": "Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee is on a world tour. No, he isn’t pumping out pop songs or signing books. The Wall Street analyst is touting the good word of Bitcoin, and why the cryptocurrency market is ready to be catapulted into its next bull run, expected to be the biggest yet. Most recently, Lee, who became prominent in the digital asset space after becoming the poster child for Bitcoin optimism in 2017, appeared on Yahoo Finance to elaborate on why BTC is and will do so well. This is the umpteenth time he has made a Bitcoin-related appearance on mainstream media in the past six weeks.  During a Monday segment of “On The Move”, Lee sat down, clad in his navy-blue suit, to try and reason why Bitcoin has been outperforming traditional assets as of late. He suggests that much of the recent move has a lot to do with uncertainty on the geopolitical and macroeconomic stage, which has recently been slammed by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, Brexit, and the financial collapses of Venezuela, Argentina, and other nations. The Fundstrat co-founder notes that Bitcoin is acting much like “digital gold”, giving investors a chance to hedge their bets against crisis with a revolutionary asset that is digital through scarce. He isn’t the first to have suggested that the recently geopolitical trends have been a tailwind for Bitcoin and its ilk. A report from the South China Morning Post recently pointed out that after Donald Trump, the president of the U.S., announced tariff changes on Chinese imports, BTC began to rally. Simultaneously, the yuan purportedly fell to its lowest level in six months, as China looked to move against Trump. Garrick Hileman of Blockchain.com told the outlet that the Yuan has traded inversely to Bitcoin in the past. And most recently, Barry Silbert, the chief executive of industry conglomerate Digital Currency Group, told Fortune’s “Balancing The Ledger” that in this trade war, Bitcoin is acting as a “non-correlated asset”. He looks to Brexit news correlating with movements in the BTC market to further illustrate his point that this move may have much to do with geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Lee’s points, along with those made by his colleagues, can be contrasted to those made by Erik Voorhees, the chief executive of ShapeShift. Last week, we reported that Voorhees suggested to Bloomberg TV that the recent move is a result of investors across the board coming to the conclusion that the bottom is finally in, and have begun to scale into the market as a unit. Let’s say that the geopolitical strains die down, does that mean BTC will return lower again? According to Lee, likely not. In fact, he asserted that by many measures, “crypto winter” is over, no questions asked. In a recent Twitter post, the Fundstrat representative gave 13 reasons why the bear market is over. Some of these important reasons include the fact that Bitcoin quickly returned to $8,000 after the $1,700 dump on Bitstamp; the Bitcoin Misery Index passing above 89, a sign only seen in bull markets; a grow in on-chain activity and volumes, which historically have preceded rallies; and the fact that Bitcoin’s chart recently saw a bullish “golden cross” pattern” while BTC moved above its 200-day moving average in spectacular fashion.  And most recently, Lee noted that the fact that Bitcoin futures contracts on BitMEX for June and September have begun to trade well above spot prices is the fourteenth sign that winter is over. And from here, the analyst expects for BTC to post new all-time highs by 2020.",

        "passage": "Blockstack PBC recently announced that its subsidiary, Blockstack Token LLC made a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $50 million token offering through the regulatory body’s Regulation A+ Framework. The company is making efforts to comply with the SEC and approval would mean that the Blockstack could sell its Stacks (STX) tokens. Additionally, a nod from the regulatory body would stand the company’s token out as the first ever SEC- qualified token offering.  Blockstack PBC, a blockchain computing network headquartered in New York, announced on Thursday, April 11, that its subsidiary, Blockstack Token LLC, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $50 million in token sales. According to the company’s blog, the token offering would use SEC’s Regulation A+ framework. The Regulatory A+ framework, which serves as an alternative to the traditional IPO, is an updated version of the Regulation A. The updated version also offers an exemption for smaller companies that wish to offer and sell securities. With the Regulatory A+ comes two tiers, Tier 1 and Tier 2, with the former offering $20 million and the latter offering $50 million, both over a 12-month period. Blockstack filed an offering statement with the SEC using Tier 2. According to the filing submitted on Thursday, the company would offer 295 million Stack Tokens. The breakdown included 215 million tokens for $0.12 each and 40 million tokens for $0.30 each. Blockstack plans to offer the remaining 40 million Stack Tokens for “non-cash consideration” in line with its “App Mining Program” which would be used to develop standard applications on the company’s platform. With approval from the SEC, Blockstack’s token sale would be the first ever SEC-qualified token offering. The recent move by the company would set the pace for other players in the sector and would usher in regulated tokens. The release further noted that the company was creating a framework in strict compliance with the SEC guidelines. Speaking further on the matter, Co-founder and CEO of Blockstack PBC, Dr. Muneeb Ali said: Muneeb further stated that the towing the regulatory line was a conscious decision, with the knowledge that would be time-consuming and require plenty of work. The SEC has constantly referred to most token offerings as “securities”, with the cryptocurrency projects referring to their tokens as “utility” instead. In 2017, SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton stated that tokens and offerings marketed with the aim of getting profit, fall under the U.S. Security Law. In April 2019, the commission released a guidance framework that tried to clearly define the categorization of token offerings. The Blockstack filing further revealed that Harvard University is also investing in the company’s million-dollar token offering. The university’s endowment along with two other investors are participating in the company’s token sale. An excerpt from the filing reads: The remaining four are independent members, which include Koen Langendoen, Arvind Narayanan, Arianna Simpson, and Catherine Tucker. Morgan Creek’s Anthony Pompliano took to his Twitter handle to tweet the university’s involvement.  Back in 2018, another Ivy League School, Yale University, also dabbled into the virtual currency market. The university invested in a digital currency fund called Paradigm, that raised $400 million. Even with concerns bordering from lack of regulation to money laundering, the involvement of different institutions in the cryptocurrency market shows the continuous expansion of the industry. With the educational sector gradually warming up to virtual currency, adoption is set for an all-time high.",

        "passage": "Just like that, mainstream media outlets have come out of the woodwork to cover Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. While such platforms often bring on cynical bears, entrenched in traditional finance, to bash the crypto narratives, today, CNBC called on Fundstrat Global Advisors’ resident BTC cheerleader Tom Lee to talk. And, surprisingly enough, Lee was, well, optimistic. But can you blame him? Bitcoin is up over 80% in the past six weeks after all.  Like him or not, Fundstrat’s co-founder, Tom Lee, is persistent when it comes to being bullish on Bitcoin. Throughout the bear market, he was laughed at for touting bullish narratives, at many times claiming that the only route for Bitcoin was up. And, at long last, he has been vindicated. Since the cryptocurrency market’s (seeming) bottom on December 14th, when BTC was trading at a rather sad $3,150, the asset has gone up 150%, sitting at a cool $8,100 as of the time of writing this. Let’s take a look at what Lee thinks. During a segment with CNBC’s “Futures Now”, the Fundstrat executive explained that crypto’s premier conference, Consensus, is another sign that Bitcoin is actually out of the woods. He explains that such an event is important, as the industry needs to be brought together in a “much more higher-quality form [than the] scams and ICOs” that were all the rage in the previous rally. This wasn’t the only sign he used to accentuate that the so-called “crypto winter” is over. Lee notes that Bitcoin holding above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level; developments on the financialization of cryptocurrency (Bakkt and ErisX to soon launch Bitcoin trading products); and long-time digital asset “hodlers” and “whales” bolstering their positions are a set of clear signs that the bear market has finally bitten the dust. But most importantly, the researcher suggests that the fact that Bitcoin has begun to near $10,000 for the first time in over a year could just be the nail in the coffin for the bear market. He elaborates that as BTC edges closer to quintuple digits, there will be an “increasing chance that traditional, non-crypto investors, traditional financial investors, are going to start to look at crypto again.” He adds that this demand and interest will be what will propel the cryptocurrency market to new highs eventually. Unfortunately, he didn’t give a date for this pseudo-prediction. Lee is far from the only cryptocurrency optimist in this environment. Speaking to CNBC Africa’s Ran NeuNer in the latest episode of “Crypto Trader”, Travis Kling of Ikigai Capital Management claimed that he is 95% sure that the Bitcoin bottom is in. Kling, a former institutional investor, opined that the increase in “reflexivity,” a term used to describe the positive feedback loop of financial markets (investment leads to a higher price, which then leads to more investment), in crypto markets will be a long-term bullish catalyst. He explains that as BTC begins to flirt with key price levels, more and more investors will be drawn in, just due to simple human psychology and greed, leading to a long-term boom.  And from the realm of pure technical analysis, there is quite the telling sign that a bull market is finally on. As popular researcher Willy Woo explained recently on Twitter, through Bitcoin’s lifetime, BTC holding above its 200-day moving average for around eight weeks has always been a sign that a bull market is on. With this technical trend currently coming to fruition, with the asset holding above the aforementioned level for nearly six weeks now, he stated that he is 99% sure that “bull season” is on.",

        "passage": "Analysts at Bank of America think current downdraft in cryptocurrency prices could be a harbinger of more pain ahead. They don’t think the sell-off will be limited to the crypto markets, and see the selling pressure in the oil space as part-and-parcel of a much wider movement out of risky assets. According to a report that Reuters reproduced, Bank of America thinks that the action in crypto markets suggests that another “flash crash” could be near. Modern markets are more-or-less directed by trading algorithms, which opens up the door to sudden movements that may make little sense to the humans that can’t react in microseconds.  Bank of America strategists said that: The idea that cryptos and oil are correlated is a new one. The crypto market is still tiny. Over the last week it fell below the $200 billion USD level. That is smaller than many companies that are traded on major exchanges. Strategists at Bank of America see this ongoing selling pressure as evidence of a bear market in the crypto space, and perhaps a broader bias away from risk. There couldn’t be a direct connection between a sell-off in the crypto space and established markets, and cryptos are far too small to affect the wider equity and commodity exchanges. It is true that the crypto space and crude oil have been sold hard over the last month. Industrial metals like copper were hit hard earlier this year, but unlike cryptos and oil, copper prices have been steady over the last month. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) also think that BTC prices are heading lower. According to a report published on November 16, BI thinks that BTC could fall as far as $1,500. That would represent a fall of at least another 60% from current levels, which are lower than many in the crypto community thought were possible. The fall from last year’s highs has been brutal for investors who entered the market late. Current levels are already far below the highs that BTC hit last December, and another major leg down would create near-total losses for anyone who bought cryptos in the late months of 2017. Travis Kling told Bloomberg he “didn’t sleep well” as a result of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, and that, “There’s a small chance that, it’s difficult to estimate, that something really bad could happen related to Bitcoin Cash that could then impact the entire crypto market.” BI analyst Mike McGlone seemed to be on the same page. He was quoted by Bloomberg as saying, that the recent fall, “was sparked by the pump for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.” He went on to posit that the, “pump that began a few weeks ago, got the market a bit too offsides with speculative longs playing for the good-old days. But this is an enduring bear market.” The should be little doubt left that the prices paid for BTC last year were almost wholly speculative in nature. Much of the hype surrounding the first crypto was clearly unjustified, and now people who made major investments in the sector are being hit hard as the price-floor appears to be giving way.  Read: Is Bitcoin in a Bubble? It would be a mistake to underestimate the kind of psychological damage that a speculative bubble can create. The rapid price rise in crypto prices during 2017 demanded the world’s attention, and today people everywhere are watching the sector implode. In time, cryptos may rise from the ashes, but it could take much longer than anyone expects.",

        "passage": "Blockchain is getting a lot of attention from universities around the world. It is a hot new field of study, but it can also help universities to share information securely. Higher education is one of the most important areas of modern life. A degree from a prestigious university can be extremely valuable. Unfortunately, there is no international system that helps to establish the legitimacy of a degree.  Today a person who studies in the USA is likely to seek employment in the global job market. Any employer wants to make sure that a potential employee’s educational credentials are accurate. The only way to confirm an educational record today requires direct contact with a university, and potentially other schools as well. In light of this fact, numerous educational institutions came together to create the Groningen Declaration. In short, the Groningen Declaration is a an international effort to streamline information sharing in the global educational community. Today universities are also faced with new challenges to their existing fields of study, which expanded blockchain curriculum could help them overcome. So far more than 40 US universities have signed on to the Groningen Declaration. Globally this number is much higher. Despite the international push for easier access to secure academic records, there has been little in the way of agreement on how the platform could develop further in the real world. According to a report that was authored by Merija Jirgensons and Janis Kapenieks of Riga Technical University (RTU) in Latvia, there doesn’t seem to be a consensus emerging on how best to structure a global blockchain platform. To wit, “The Europeans, especially in the UK, have preferred Ethereum; while the Americans have opted for the bitcoin blockchain,” the report states. The report from RTU goes on to say that, “Most states in the EU are planning blockchain strategies to fit national agendas, and most employ the Ethereum blockchain.” The report cites the MIT Blockcerts application as an example, “(MIT Blockcerts) is currently unavailable for Ethereum,” which is the architecture favored by government developers in Europe. The university system is famous for being slow to adapt to new technology. The rise in DLT is a perfect example of how higher education has been left behind, and is refusing to adopt a more market-oriented approach to their information architecture. When blockchain programs are offered to university students, the level of interest has been extremely high. Blockchain is being researched by numerous global mega-corporations, and has received support that can be measured in the billions of dollars by governments. If universities keep resisting blockchain-based platforms, they risk being shut out of an emerging development culture. While many universities have been slow to invest in blockchain education, the University of California at Berkeley (UoC Berkeley), is working on bringing together blockchain technology, education, and the community. Ben Bartlett asked an assembly of students at UoC Berkeley, “We have at least 1,400 homeless people in our city, and that includes many right here at UC Berkeley,” Councilman Bartlett told the class. “So how can we use blockchain to fund a new prosperity? That’s a challenge I’d like you to take on.” The class that city council member Ben Bartlett was addressing is being taught by Po Chi Wu, who is a visiting professor and former venture capitalist. UoC Berkeley isn’t alone in offering blockchain courses to their students. New York University, Stanford, and Georgetown are also jumping into a field that has created a 200% rise in job postings on a yearly basis. In a field that is just beginning to hit the mainstream, universities that choose to develop curriculum that helps their students enter a growing industry are going to secure long term access to the blockchain world via their alumni. For the moment there is little interaction between the government in the US and nascent blockchain-focused university departments, which is another area where other nations seem to be pulling ahead of the USA.",

        "passage": "Iran’s government is looking at increased Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption as a way of ensuring the flow of much-needed revenue from its tourism industry. This move comes as state officials try to prevent the country’s booming tourism sector from being negatively impacted by the resumption of U.S.-led economic sanctions. Both public and private stakeholders are reportedly looking at the benefits of adopting cryptocurrency payments to lift any possible restrictions suffered by visitors to the countries as far as payments are concerned.  According to Al-Monitor, there is a growing interest between important actors in both the Iranian government and the private sector to explore the use of cryptocurrency payments in the tourism industry. With the onset of renewed economic sanctions, there are fears that visitors to the country will have limited payment avenues while in Iran, a situation that would severely hamper its tourism appeal. When a coalition of nations led by the U.S. lifted sanctions against Iran in 2015, it led to a renaissance in its tourism industry. The subsequent boom saw annual revenues of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion in 2015 and 2016, all from tourism alone. Global hospitality brands also recognized the emerging market and established a significant business presence in the country as well. So, with fresh sanctions, Tehran is looking for a way to protect the cash cow that is its tourism sector, by adopting cryptocurrency payments. The major problem likely faced by visitors to the country is the inability to make payments using mainstream avenues like credit/debit cards. Thus, the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (CHTO) is leading to charge to see the benefits that lie in the intersection of virtual currency adoption and the nations tourism sector. One of the options being seriously considered is the introduction of a state-backed cryptocurrency. The CHTO is reportedly looking to partner with India, to create a joint virtual currency in the hopes of developing strong tourism ties with both countries. Also, there are plans to create a state-backed digital coin specifically meant for Iran’s tourism scene. However, experts opine that such a move does little to solve the problem of access to local currency. Instead, stakeholders believe that the adoption of a widely used cryptocurrency like Bitcoin would be more advantageous. Speaking to Al-Monitor about the matter, Ziya Sadr, a senior executive at IranByBit, a local travel agency that accepts BTC payments, said: For Iran, the emergence of BTC and other cryptocurrencies offers an opportunity to have access to global payment infrastructure despite U.S. economic sanctions. Going by the measures being taken on the tourism front, it seems like the government isn’t prepared to allow its economic situation deteriorate any further. In 2018, the rial plummeted by more than 60 percent in value. Many citizens reportedly turned to Bitcoin despite attempts by the government to restrict such activities in the fear of increased capital flight. Since the start of the year, Tehran has begun to take preliminary steps to regulate the cryptocurrency market in the country with the initial focus on the legality of virtual currencies.",

A few months ago, University of Texas finance professor John Griffin released a document stating that bitcoin’s price swell during 2017 was the result of manipulation by investors who were tying the currency to Tether, an alleged stable coin backed by USD. The report suggests that every time bitcoin’s price dropped in 2017 by even a marginal amount, the group would use Tether to purchase bitcoin, thereby tying it to U.S. dollar reserves and causing further spikes in its price. Though executives of the stable coin state they’ve done no wrong, the report alleges that the maneuvers were first-class manipulation tactics and has, in turn, caused organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to step in and investigate. A company audit of Tether has potentially confirmed that the purported manipulation did not take place, and even Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has taken a stance, siding with Tether and rejecting Griffin’s claims. Whether such a move really took place remains to be seen. However, the subject of manipulation has often been a large – and recurring – theme in the cryptocurrency arena, and now it’s making its way back into news forums. The latest report from the Attorney General’s office of New York explains that online platforms where cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be bought and sold by individual customers do not have the same level of security as traditional banks or other establishments that house assets like precious metals. Thus, market manipulation is a constant threat, as is the risk of customer information falling into the wrong hands. Attorney General Barbara Underwood explains: The organization is now looking into whether three specific cryptocurrency exchanges might be operating illegally within the Big Apple. These platforms include Binance, Kraken and Gate.io. All three have been under the Attorney General’s observation since April of this year after they refused to participate in the office’s Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, in which 13 specific digital exchanges operating in New York were asked to share information regarding the safety of their practices. For the past five months, the three exchanges in question have not cooperated with Underwood or her team. Some of the information in the report details how various exchanges can often overlap certain lines of business. These include executives trading for their own accounts on their own venues, thereby representing serious conflicts of interest per the report’s verbiage. In addition, several exchanges often issue their own unique tokens or even charge companies that seek to list those tokens. Furthermore, the document says that while some platforms do police their markets for abuse, many others do not, and that: Thus, the report deems that it’s either “difficult or impossible” to confirm that exchanges are exercising appropriate means of responsibility when it comes to holding customer accounts and keeping their funds safe.

        "passage": "Like many tech-focused industries, crypto is full of scammers. Due to the pseudonymous, digital, and private nature of the technologies that back cryptocurrencies, many bad actors have tried and leverage this asset class to make a quick buck, or Bitcoin satoshi if you will. Unfortunately, many of these scammers have succeeded in their schemes, managing to swindle industry investors out of millions in digital assets, from Bitcoin to Ripple’s XRP. But, a prominent industry Youtuber and marketing guru recently flipped the tables on a scammer, outplaying him/her.  Oh, how the tables have turned. Ben Perrin, the host of BTC Sessions, a Youtube channel focused on Bitcoin education followed by 30,000 and watched by many more, recently took to CBC to tell his story about an odd run-in with an industry scammer. Earlier this week, a scammer messaged Perrin on Instagram, promising to double his Bitcoin investment within a short period of time. This tactic is quite common, especially on Instagram, where DMs can come unsolicited and often aren’t properly screened/censored by the platform. Perrin, who has been involved in the industry for years now, immediately identified the “offer” as a scam, as it is obviously too good to be true. But, he decided to “play along”, expressing fake interest in the Bitcoin investment opportunity. In fact, he went as far as to claim he wanted to send $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to the individual, creating a fake wallet and building a false narrative. The scammer, who was likely then giddy to “steal” Perrin’s $20,000 in Bitcoin, even agreed to pay $50 to the educator to prove the “offer’s” legitimacy.  Perrin took the $50, called out the scammer, then donated the small sum to charity. His charity of choice was Bitcoin Venezuela, a BTC-centric non-profit centered on helping Venezuelans adopt the cryptocurrency as the local currency continues to inflate at a jaw-dropping pace. Funnily enough, a policeman from Calgary, Canada’s economic crime unit explained that Perrin’s approach was actually dangerous: Despite the positive story, scams are still rampant in the crypto space. Just the other day, prominent Chinese cryptocurrency venture capitalist Dovey Wan wrote that EtherDelta, one of the most prominent Ethereum decentralized exchanges, is reportedly involved in a “major scam in China”. She wrote that the scam involved the issuance of an EtherDelta Token (EDT), which turned out to be a way for the owners of the exchange to exit scam.  It is still unclear how much the owners of EtherDelta, which are unnamed Chinese investors, managed to make away with. However, there is purportedly a group of “furious investors” ringing up local police to try and spawn an investigation. This would mark one of the latest in a line of countless Chinese crypto scams. As reported by Blockonomi earlier this year, a group used the Chinese translation of “Tron” and a promise of massive capital gains to trick a group of investors into purportedly giving up $30 million. The scheme’s tactics were so damaging that local media reports that a single mother killed herself over the lost funds, which she borrowed from a neighbor and was unable to pay back. Also, there have been rumors of scams invoking the name of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in places like Australia, India, and even the U.S.",

        "passage": "According to a report from local news outlet Focus Taiwan, Taiwanese police based in New Taipei, recently arrested 15 alleged cryptocurrency scam operators. The report claims that the suspects duped investors out of about $8 million as money collected for trading banned IBCoin tokens. The news is coming barely ten days after the state indicted seven other suspects for managing a crypto-based investment scam that attracted about $51 million in investments from over 1,000 investors. A local report, had noted at the time, that the suspects had run a scheme that promised investors returns of up to 355%.  According to the reports released by the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), the activities of these fraudsters revolved around IBCoin, a digital asset based on Ethereum’s ERC20 technology, that has already been banned for use by the Taiwanese authorities. Also, the CIB reports that the coin, which isn’t being traded or dealt with by any known company, doesn’t “have any real value.” The fraudsters allegedly embarked on false publicity efforts on various social media platforms as a means of luring unsuspecting victims. In addition to that, the leader of the group, whose surname was given as Lin, was reportedly purchasing IBCoin tokens from foreign traders at a price of NT$1.5 per unit (the equivalent of $0.05) back in 2017. Then, with the help of the other arrested contractors and traders, he sold the tokens to investors for rates as high as NT$50 to NT$100 (between $1.63 and $3.27), with the promise of higher returns.  Image © Focus Taiwan The group is said to have made about NNT$250 million (roughly $8.16 million) from the scam. On the flip side, the CIB reports that no single investor had profited from the scheme since it launched. Apart from the lack of returns given to investors, the group also reportedly drew additional scrutiny thanks to the luxury, investor-bankrolled lifestyle that they lived. The group floated luxury cars on social media as a means of showing off their wealth and luring more investors. The scammers have been charged with fraud, and the CIB has already handed the case over to the Taipei District Prosecutors Officer, who is expected to set a proper trial date in the coming days. The CIB also stated that they have been able to recover over NT$2.02 million (about $70,000) in cash, along with three vehicles and written documents about the fraudulent scheme, while conducting two separate raids on January 9 and 17. Back in November 2018, Taiwanese authorities introduced sterner Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies as a means of ensuring that crypto exchanges in the country help to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies or fraudulent activities. Amongst other things, the Money Laundering Control Act and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act gave Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) complete oversight over crypto exchanges in the country and the prerogative to ban any crypto-based transactions that it deemed as fraudulent According to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Justice, the move was carried out in an attempt to ensure that the Taiwanese-crypto based companies maintain a “compliance culture and mindset,” which will help the government meet up with international AML standards. Still, it would seem that the stringent AML laws haven’t been as effective as the Taiwanese government would have hoped, as crypto scams are still quite popular in the country. In December 2018, local news reported that a Taiwanese man, whose surname was given as Yang, was accused of stealing $3 million worth of electricity to mine Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) worth 100 million Yuan (about $14.5 million). The suspect was reported to have over 17 business premises pen cafes and toy shops as fronts for his business. He reportedly hired electricians to wire the electrical systems of these businesses to avoid any metering or detection. However, an investigation was launched when the Taiwan Power Company noticed discrepancies in the power supply.",

        "passage": "Litecoin is currently enjoying a significant price gain, up by more than twelve percent over the last 24 hours as the rest of the cryptocurrency market remains relatively stagnant but still in the green. The popular altcoin is now ranked 4th according to CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization north of $2.2 billion.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Litecoin has gained more than 12 percent in the last 24 hours. As at press time, LTC leads the top altcoins based on price gains over the previous 24-hour trading period. Currently, at $36 and counting, LTC is at its highest price level in more than three weeks. The 4th-ranked cryptocurrency is closing in on its 2019 high of $40. Litecoin is still miles away from its all-time high of $362 set in mid-December 2017.  Like most of the cryptocurrency market, LTC suffered massive losses during the 2018 bear market. The altcoin created by ex-Google Engineer, Charlie Lee, slid more than 90 percent as cryptocurrency prices tanked. Concerning the current price gain, it appears the recently announced partnership between the Litecoin Foundation and Beam is responsible. With this in mind, the price rally could be short-lived. In a blog post published by Beam on Thursday (February 7, 2019), the company revealed that it was in discussions with the Litecoin Foundation over a possible implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol on the Litecoin blockchain. An excerpt from the post reads:  With these ongoing discussions, it appears Litecoin is preparing to explore the introduction of privacy features. Using extension blocks running Mimblewimble implementation, LTC users will be able to make use of privacy features not originally part of the Litecoin operating construct. This partnership with Beam to introduce privacy features on Litecoin is coming at a time of significant debate over the overall usefulness of LTC. The appears to be a growing sentiment in some quarters that the emergence of Lightning Network and other off-chain Bitcoin protocol layers effectively render all “Bitcoin-like” altcoins obsolete. In times past, the core of the argument for LTC has been that Bitcoin will inevitably approach a point when the network supersaturated, vastly reducing transaction throughput efficiency. Thus, a lightweight network like LTC will find greater adoption, especially for microtransactions. However, the introduction of SegWit and the continued expansion of Lighting Network functionality severely impacts the validity of these claims. By pivoting to the privacy arena, LTC might be able to carve another niche for itself in the emerging cryptocurrency landscape. LTC’s current surge comes on a day of slight positive price gains for the cryptocurrency market at large. The top ten coins are all currently in the green based on 24-hour price performance as is the majority of the other cryptos in the top-100 ranking. Bitcoin gained $20 at the start of the trading day in an unlikely “pump” given recent events and is up by almost one percent since February 7, 2019. Outside the top ten, the likes of HyperCash (HC), Veritaserum (VERI), and Quant (QNT) lead the gainer’s chart with an average 24-hour price increase of 16 percent. On the flip side, Basic Attention Token (BAT) seems to have reached the end of its mini-rally on account of the recent Coinbase announcement. BAT is down by more than three percent, with Bytecoin (BCN) and THETA (THETA) among the other top losers for the day.",

        "passage": "CEO and founder of crypto exchange ShapeShift, Erik Vorhees believes Facebook’s Libra is superior to and can effectively replace any fiat currency in the world, including the U.S. Dollar. In a Twitter thread yesterday, Vorhees submitted his nuanced analysis of the much-speculated stablecoin. In the tweet, Vorhees acceded that Facebook’s digital currency has the potential to change the face of financial transactions on a global scale. However, he also pointed out that the benefits do not come without critical downsides that require careful consideration before the inevitable mass adoption of the Libra.  The Libra project is backed by 28 of the world’s biggest companies, including Visa, PayPal, Spotify and Uber, and is Facebook’s giant step towards creating a generally-accepted decentralized currency.  The main use case for Libra is peer-to-peer payments, but there are plans to support in-store payments, integrations into Point-of-sale systems and partner apps like Uber or Paypal. More importantly, the currency can be sent or received using Facebook’s own Calibra wallet, which would have a standalone app and an integration into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. According to Vorhees, the currency succeeds in facilitating seamless financial transactions without the involvement of banks and other go-betweens. The Libra coin also trumps major digital currencies in that it will not suffer the same volatility that they do, seeing as it is pegged to a basket of global heavyweight fiat currencies, including the dollar, euro, and yen. Facebook’s cryptocurrency initiative provides solutions to two glitches in traditional financial transactions- speed, and exorbitant middlemen charges. If it does succeed with its plan, payments should become as easy as sending a photo, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes to say. Cryptocurrencies were created to proffer solutions to these problems too, particularly stablecoins like the controversial Tether and the Gemini Dollar. What makes Libra unique is the potential speed at which it could be adopted across Facebook’s vast ecosystem. According to Vorhees, Libra’s pegging to government assets like fiat currencies is a double-edged sword. Currencies that are pegged to fiat tend to “fail relative to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold, etc.).” This is due to the debasement of fiat currencies by politicians, which happens every time the government prints more money, eroding the purchasing power. Vorhees also predicts that Facebook’s Libra would be heavily scrutinized by governments across the world, where it plans to operate. While the social media giant seems to have the resources needed to sway regulations in their favor, Vorhees hopes they have the “balls” to actually do so, in the face of stern regulatory environments.  Crypto enthusiasts have been divided in their opinion about Libra. While some have praised the idea, others have continued to bash both the currency and the founder. Those who oppose Libra are drawing incentive from the numerous security and data breaches that have been reported about the platform. Talks of bias and user control on Facebook are widely circulated on Twitter, speculating that Facebook cannot be trusted with users’ finance due to their checkered past with privacy.  However, Facebook has declared that all transactions, history, and user data are conducted independent of the social network, and user data will not be manipulated for ads or other unauthorized purposes. According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, “It’s decentralized — meaning it’s run by many different organizations instead of just one, making the system fairer overall.”",

        "passage": "Bitcoin continues to be the subject of controversy among both educated financiers and the public. Some believe crypto will one day replace both fiat and credit cards and stand as the financial king of the monetary arena. Others, however, are convinced that digital assets will disappear faster than we expect – a one-time fad that will run its course and eventually die out.  One of the big arguments against virtual money is its volatility. Cryptocurrency is known for swinging up and down in impressive fashion. Last year, bitcoin rose all the way up to $19,000 – its highest position in history, while other entities, like Ethereum, were trading for roughly $1,400. The crypto market felt rock solid, and investors were feeling proud of themselves… But since January of this year, crypto has been sinking deeper and deeper into oblivion. Bitcoin, for example, has lost over 70 percent of its value, and is now trading for about $6,400 at press time. Ethereum, on the other hand, has done even worse, losing more than 80 percent in the past eight months and trading for roughly $274. These are massive losses to contend with, and many investors are turning their backs on crypto for good. Several former traders admit that they got caught up in the hype surrounding crypto and didn’t bother to do the proper research before getting involved. One man – Pete Roberts of Nottingham, England – claims to be one such person. He invested roughly $23,000 of his personal savings in digital tokens last year when they were at their highest points, only to see his investments fall to about $4,000. Now, he’s just trying to stay afloat as best he can. Sadly, this is just one corner of the world. The drops are affecting people on a global scale, and countries like South Korea – a one-time major bitcoin haven – has seen a massive slump in both cryptocurrency interest and activity over the past few months. Coinone, for example, is one of South Korea’s largest digital exchanges. Employee Yu Ji-Hoon says that the falls in token prices have greatly affected business, and that customers are disappearing on a regular basis. Last week, the company only saw person enter its offices for a two-hour meeting. No doubt, the public is feeling the pain. 45-year-old teacher and mother Kim Hyon-jeong lives on the outskirts of Seoul. She says she invested approximately $90,000 USD in cryptocurrencies last fall, utilizing her personal savings, an insurance policy, and even a private bank loan of roughly $25,000 to hit that figure. She says her investments have now dropped down to about $10,000. She comments: While some have been affected by the drops in cryptocurrency prices, others have managed to pull their weight, but cast doubts on the technology behind digital tokens. Charles Herman, for instance, is a 29-year-old small business owner in South Carolina. He says he’s wasted almost an entire year of his life playing the cryptocurrency market. While he’s earned back the $4,000 he initially put in, he believes the promises of financial revolution cryptocurrencies offer are false. He says:",

        "passage": "Can blockchain make sex obsolete? That’s the bizarre question posed by Hackernoon author Shawn Gordon. Well, at least that was the title of his tongue-in-cheek post which brings up the real question – has our belief in the almighty blockchain gone too far? Is it really the be all, end all solution to all of man’s problems? And more importantly, are all of these ICO’s coming out today really going to be able to deliver on their outlandish promises? According to Gordon, perhaps we need to reel in our expectations.  It is our opinion here at Blockonomi that blockchain and cryptocurrencies (two separate but related concepts) are indeed some of the most important innovations of our time. And while blockchain is indeed such an important technology, it is not the ultimate solution to everything. There are some tasks that blockchain is downright lousy at addressing. So what is blockchain good for? It’s a excellent way of storing critical, small pieces of information across a distributed network. It is an excellent way to maintain an immutable record of events, and it is a revolutionary way to create an all-digital form of cash that requires no middleman or gatekeepers. New uses for blockchain are coming out all the time. While many of them are indeed interesting, a number of them are probably too half-baked to become a reality in our lifetimes. One point that Shawn Gordon made about blockchain-based logistics and tracking systems is that they are only as good or as reliable as the information they are given. The system still largely relies on human input, and humans are notorious for producing incorrect, inaccurate or intentionally falsified data when it benefits them. This refers to a computing concept known as garbage in, garbage out. Basically speaking, if the data supplied to a blockchain project (ostensibly by humans, but perhaps even from automated sources) is of poor quality, then the output of the system no matter how advanced it is will be garbage as well.  Read: Blockchain & Supply Chain Management In the case of a logistics system, if humans are incentivized to lie about the origin of goods or how long they’ve been sitting in a warehouse before being entered into a blockchain system, then it’s pretty reasonable to assume that this will happen. Speaking of their experience at a conference, Gordon wrote: We’re not going to name specific projects here, but instead general concepts that have been applied to one or more different alleged blockchain projects or ICO’s. We say alleged in this case because some of these projects, according to Gordon, may launch an ICO before they even have a single programmer or blockchain expert on their team.  Read: How to Pick Good ICOs On this severe lack of critical team members, Gordon wrote: With that in mind, let’s go over a few of the more far-fetched ideas that we think are pretty unlikely to become reality or see much of any adoption in the next decade or so. A few projects have come out in the last year or so that focus on providing something that they will call either a dispute resolution service, or even in some cases, a jury service. These systems claim that by using smart contracts, individuals can effectively “sue” each other whenever a business or personal deal goes bad. This digital pseudo-lawsuit or arbitration case is then presented to a randomly selected group of voters who will decide who is right and who is wrong. Whomever wins the majority of votes is determined the winner of the case and the smart contract will release or withhold payment accordingly. What makes this kind of project seem too unrealistic is that typically speaking, the voters or jury members are financially incentivized to behave in a certain perhaps unfair way. That being, they are incentivized to vote with their wallet and not with their heart or convictions. In one project, only the voters who voted for the winning side will receive payment for their participation. This means that if a voter truly believes option A is the correct answer, but option B is most likely to win, then they are incentivized to choose option B even though option B could be objectively wrong. There are at least a handful of projects that are touting that by giving out their own tokens or coins for free to anyone and everyone, that will somehow cure poverty. Typically these projects compare themselves to the much debated concept of a universal basic income, or UBI. UBI being an experiment that Finland tried and later considered the test a failure. The problem with this idea is that while perhaps well intentioned (unless it turns out to be a scam), tokens or coins that are given out freely will inevitably be worthless. The reason why bitcoin is valuable is because it’s not given out freely and it’s hard to come by – or expensive to purchase. Cryptocurrencies can bring modern finance to underserved areas and that can change lives for the better, but tossing around valueless tokens or coins for free won’t help anyone. Another trend in the blockchain space is the idea that anything and everything can, nay, must be tokenized. Cars, houses, office buildings, airports, armies, furniture, pets, you name it. The idea of tokenizing real estate is certainly interesting, but the ability to commit fraud or suffer from GIGO is just too high. Most services that want to offer tokenization rely on paid “experts” to verify the real world asset before a split tokenized smart contract is created and sold. But how can we trust these so-called experts? What’s to stop one of them from listing a skyscraper that doesn’t exist, then pocketing the millions of dollars in proceeds and disappearing?  Read: Blockchain & Real Estate The simple fact is that people can’t be trusted outright, and it’s just a matter of time until these tokenized assets start to represent real world things that don’t exist or never existed in the first place. As Shawn Gordon said: As for us, it can certainly be exciting to think that you’re getting in on the ground floor of an entirely new market or technology. However, it’s important to remember that we still live in the real world, and blockchain is just another way of doing things that have already been done for thousands of years. That is, keep track of records and be a medium of exchange of value. With that said, be sure to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground before you get involved in any blockchain project that you don’t really understand, or whose team you don’t have a very strong understanding of.",

        "passage": "The operators of the Nasdaq, the second-largest stock exchange in the world, have added a new index to their bustling platform that notably tracks cryptoeconomy and decentralized finance (DeFi) natives like Augur and MakerDAO. That index, dubbed DeFiX, is backed by the international brokerage brand Exante and now available on the NASDAQ through the ticker symbol DEFX — short for Decentralized Finance Index. According to Nasdaq, the offering is the “first altcoin index that reflects the dynamics of the most promising blockchain projects working in decentralized finance.”  Specifically, the projects initially being tracked by the index include 0x (ZRX), Maker (MKR), Augur (REP), Gnosis (GNO), Numerai (NMR), and Amoveo (VEO). 0x is a permissionless exchange protocol; Maker backs the popular Dai stablecoin; Numerai is a crowdsourced hedge fund; and Augur, Gnosis, and Amoveo have prediction market offerings. The DEFX listing is only the latest cryptocurrency-centric embrace the Nasdaq has made so far in 2019. Back in February, the powerhouse exchange listed the Bitcoin Liquid Index and the Ethereum Liquid Index to help traders track the prices of bitcoin and ether. A short time later, the platform listed the XRP Liquid Index (XRPLX), and a few weeks after those listings Nasdaq partnered with CryptoCompare to create the Nasdaq/CryptoCompare Aggregate Crypto Reference Prices tracker, which provides “minute-by-minute pricing data for the most liquid cryptocurrency markets.” For its part, Exante has been involved with the cryptoeconomy since 2012, when the firm launched its inaugural bitcoin fund — a fund the company says has made returns exceeding 70,000 percent to date. Before DeFiX, Exante last launched its XAI Fund in 2017. The offering gave investors a means to invest in a portfolio of top altcoin projects like Ethereum and Monero. Nasdaq seems to increasingly have crypto on the brain. In November 2017, reporting broke that the stock exchange giant was planning on launching a bitcoin futures product by the end of 2018. That never ended up happening, though it was later confirmed by investment management firm VanEck that Nasdaq was working to launch the futures product in the first half of 2019. That launch also passed with no release, though it seems the exchange is just taking its time rather than rushing the product out. As company chief executive officer Adena Friedman explained last January: Last spring, Friedman even went so far as to say Nasdaq “would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time.” And if it doesn’t become one, the platform at least plans to work with them. The company allegedly spearheaded a meeting last summer with six popular cryptocurrency exchanges, with the theme of the meeting being about helping these trading venues mature. Moreover, the platform’s venture arm Nasdaq Ventures participated in the $27.5 million Series B funding round of ErisX, a platform set to be a competitor to Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets. In somewhat related news, Coinbase announced its new Coinbase USDC Bootstrap Fund on September 10th. “The Fund will support developers building DeFi protocols by investing USDC directly in the protocol,” the exchange said. With the announcement came the reveal of the fund’s first two investments, which were $1 million USDC to “money lego” money market protocol Compound and $1 million USDC to margin trading protocol dYdX. Both platforms are currently among the top 5 most popular DeFi projects according to tracker site DeFi Pulse.",

        "passage": "Brian Kelly of BKCM LLC believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is to break new grounds as it begins another bullish phase. BTC – the top-ranked cryptocurrency is up more than 40 percent since the start of 2019. Despite a couple of price pullbacks, Bitcoin has stayed above the $5,000 price level leading many to speculate that BTC is in a bullish cycle. Several analysts and commentators forecast a positive run for Bitcoin with some expecting BTC to reach a new all-time high (ATH).  Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday (April 10, 2019) Kelly declared that the fall to $3,100 in December 2018 marked a new long-term low for Bitcoin. After trading sideways between the Summer and Fall of 2018, BTC crashed in mid-November amid a bitter civil war in the Bitcoin Cash arena.  The strain from the Bitcoin Cash hash war saw BTC fundamentals take a nosedive leading to a reduction in the confidence of many in the market. The result, the BTC price careened from $6,000 to $3,100. Commenting on the matter, Kelly said: Kelly’s based his assertions about the coming Bitcoin resurgence on the emergence of favorable technical and market fundamentals. Earlier in the year, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors declared that many of the negative market conditions of 2018 had flipped to the positive side. The BKCM chief espoused the same position mentioning the imminent arrival of important institutional developments like the Fidelity custody platform. There is also a marked increase in institutional capital flowing into the BTC market. Recent data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed that there was a massive spike in long BTC futures contracts leading up to the April 2019 surge. The CME Bitcoin futures platform recorded an 88 percent increase in long BTC bets on April 2, 2019. According to Kelly: On the retail side, the Kimchi Premium in South Korea is also beginning to reappear. The BTC markup in the South Korean market is a major indicator of bullish sentiment. Recent reports also indicate that Chinese traders are also paying a premium to purchase BTC. On the technical fundamental side, the story is also similar. According to Kelly, active BTC wallet addresses has increased by more than 26 percent since the start of 2018. Also, the transaction volume of the BTC blockchain is back to 2017 highs. Veteran trader and analyst, Peter Brandt earlier in April predicted that BTC was entering a parabolic phase. Brandt accurately forecasted the 80 percent price drop of 2018. Kelly expressed a similar sentiment saying that Bitcoin would reach a new ATH during this new bull cycle. Bitcoin’s current ATH stands at $19,500 set in mid-December 2017.  Kelly’s timeline covers a two-year period with the Bitcoin halving in between. According to the BKCM chief, BTC’s cycle is usually a year before to year after the halving event – when the block reward for miners gets reduced by 50 percent. However, Kelly does add that such a bullish run is contingent on the institutional side of things kicking off. Projects like the Fidelity custody platform and the Bakkt physical-BTC futures contract will likely come online in 2019.",

The Libra chief also sees adoption as a much larger concern for the cryptocurrency project than whether authorities are happy with the crypto. There continues to be strong opposition to the planned Libra launch, especially in Europe. Facebook’s crypto plans will also form part of deliberations of a Congressional hearing scheduled to hold next week.  According to Reuters, Marcus told Swiss media outlet NZZ that the Libra Association wasn’t backing down from plans to launch the cryptocurrency project. Commenting on the matter, Marcus quipped: The Libra Association has been in talks with central banks and regulatory authorities from around the world. While Libra has courted negative comments from authorities across the globe right from the off, the pressure seems to have gone up a few notches in recent weeks. Both Germany and France have come out to state they will block Facebook’s crypto in Europe. Germany’s federal cabinet recently approved its blockchain strategy with the ‘Bundeschain’ seen as a way of combating Libra in the country. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire last week called Facebook’s crypto a threat to the monetary sovereignty of nations. Marcus has since responded to these comments as reported by Blockonomi. According to the Facebook crypto chief, the stablecoin will pose no threat to the established financial infrastructure. For Marcus, regulatory scrutiny isn’t Libra’s biggest hurdle. Instead, the he identified widespread adoption as a much larger issue for the project. Commenting further on the matter, Marcus opined: In areas where Libra won’t find adoption for everyday microtransactions, Marcus expects the stablecoin to see significant use as a vehicle for cross-border transfers. China has already taken steps to counter Libra by accelerating plans for a state-issued digital currency pegged to the yuan. There is also the fact that the country already has a thriving electronic payment ecosystem with behemoths like AliPay and WeChat Pay. For cross-border transactions, Libra will also have to compete with bitcoin and cryptos like XRP. Payment companies like Visa as well as banking giants are also in the running to launch cross-border remittance solutions. Facebook’s reputation with regard to user privacy might also throw the proverbial spanner in the works as far as mainstream adoption goes. To this end, Marcus says the Libra Association is working to convince stakeholders that the social media giant will have no access to Calibra wallet data. The Financial Services Committee of the U.S. Congress says Libra will be part of its next hearing with SEC commissioners slated for Tuesday (September 24, 2019). Per a memo issued by the Committee, talks will include deliberations over whether Libra tokens constitute a security. The U.S. SEC has continued its clampdown on unregistered securities offering. For the Commission, most cryptocurrencies are securities and as such must register with the SEC or secure an exemption from securities oversight. This hearing will be the latest move by the U.S. Congress directed at Facebook’s crypto project. Back in June, Congress held a couple of sessions focused around Facebook’s proposed digital currency and cryptos in general.",

        "passage": "Using borrowed money to speculate on the financial markets is a risky activity. Most investors don’t have good risk management skills, and have a hard time understanding how quickly a position can wipe out their capital. New regulations from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will make leveraged trading safer for everyone. Since macro-trading first became popular for retail traders in the late 1990’s, there have been a lot of new brokers popping up around the world. Many of them offer leverage of up to 500:1, which means that for every 1 unit of currency, the broker will give the client 500 units to trade with. It is easy to be blinded by dreams of making a lot of money quickly with borrowed money. More often then not, leveraged retail accounts end up going bust, or even owing the broker money from a losing position that the trader held for too long.  The ESMA recently announced that effective from July 30 of this year, there will be a number of changes for any broker who is regulated by EU laws, and offers leveraged investment products to retail investors. The bottom line is that the amount of leverage that brokers can offer is dropping, which means that investors won’t be able to take on the same amount of risk. The new regulations state that the initial margin to open a position can’t be lower than 20:1, and that CFDs that represent commodities and indices will also be subject to much lower levels of leverage. These new laws will apply to just about any leveraged product, including CFDs and FOREX trading. The new ESMA regulations will also prohibit any kind of offer that incentivizes trading, and will require that brokers close out positions when a client runs out of margin. When macro trading first came on the scene in the 1970s, only professional traders had access to the markets that allowed speculation in FOREX and commodities. That has changed over the last 20 years. Now, just about anyone can open up an account at a broker who will give them high levels of leverage. Many regulators require that brokers disclose the percentage of their clients who lose money. In most cases, retail FOREX traders and CFD traders lose money (usually around 80%). The real problem comes in when a trader doesn’t understand how to use stop loss orders, or takes a ‘buy and hold’ mentality with a highly leveraged trade. The new ESMA regulations will remove many of these risks from the EU’s leveraged investment market, and put anyone who deals with an EU regulated broker in a much safer position. While the new regulations that ESMA is putting in place are probably a great idea for any trader (using 500:1 leverage is financial suicide) there are still numerous brokers that are outside of the EU who will offer their clients high levels of leverage. It is a very good idea for any trader to understand how to limit their losses, and not get into a position where a single trade wipes their entire account out in a matter of minutes. Great macro traders like Paul Tudor Jones put a large emphasis on risk management, which is something everyone can benefit from. The new ESMA regulations seem to be taking this trading philosophy to heart, and making sure retail brokers in the EU offer their clients an attractive risk/reward profile.",

        "passage": "The address of an Ethereum smart contract linked to a mysterious and apparently scammy project dubbed My Gold Coin (MGC) appears to be clogging the Ethereum network. Per the ETH Gas Station tracker site, on July 24th the median gas price to execute an Ethereum transaction was 20 gwei — a higher than usual average that indicated Ethereum was experiencing an acute usage spike.  According to the Gitcoin Gas Guzzlers page, the main culprit for the intraday surge of transactions was the MGC token contract, which can be found at 0x174BfA6600Bf90C885c7c01C7031389ed1461Ab9. Blockchain analytics site Bloxy notes that address was first created in January 2019, having facilitated a whopping eight million transactions since then, many having been airdrops of MGC. The address conducted 330,000 transactions involving MGC on July 24th alone. That’s a vast amount of activity for an utterly obscure project. As EthHub co-founder Gnosis team member Eric Conner highlighted in the tweet above, the inordinate amount of transfers means the project has already spent a small trove on gas fees with little apparent benefit. The last time Ethereum gas prices seriously spiked was mid-July, when the MGC contract was in the middle of another sudden spate of activity. The token’s address spent nearly $100,000 USD in gas fees on July 16th. As recently as July 22nd, the standard gas price on Ethereum was as low as 1 gwei per ETH Gas Station, indicating the recent activity hasn’t been constant.  So what’s clear is the backers of the MGC token are the ones mainly to blame for the current congestion on the Ethereum network. What isn’t clear exactly is what’s going on behind the scenes. However, from what little information is already available, it appears the token and its flurry of transactions are nefarious and not mundane in nature. The More Gold Coin project is seemingly a scam. There are currently several web entities linked to MGC, including an English language site at mgctoken.io, a Chinese language site at mgctoken.org, and a purportedly “official” Twitter account that features both English and Chinese. It’s not clear what connection the .io and .org sites have to each other, e.g. if one is ripped off from the next or if they have the same backers. Notably, Ethereum wallet extension MetaMask flags the .org site and another associated .biz site as being on a domain warning list for phishing scams.  “MGC Token creates a decentralized digital asset wallet with unique technological innovation,” the English landing page explains. That may read as empty hoopla, but not as figuratively empty as the Chinese page’s supposed team members, which all appear to be outright fake identities. Strange videos of these purported team members reading monotonously from MGC-centric scripts have been published on YouTube since the spring. One such video had less than 10 views at press time. Some have already directly called out the project. “It is an airdrop advertisement of a scam wallet that asks you to enter a private key to claim your reward,” TokenMarket chief technical officer Mikko Ohtamaa asserted on July 17th in a tweet that was tagged in Eric Conner’s aforementioned Wednesday thread. In a separate thread from last week, web developer Harry Denley tested the MGC application package, noting “we can confirm they were sending inputted mnemonics to their backend (which is a big no-no).”  Using that technique, the project is alleged to have already stolen more than 33,000 ether.",

        "passage": "The story behind the Ponzi scheme operated by BitConnect has taken a new turn, as the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is now seeking help from BitConnect investors. According to a statement published on its website, the federal law agency is soliciting help from those who purchased the BitConnect Coin (BCC) token, urging them to help in the ongoing case by filling out a voluntary questionnaire on its website. The agency adds that while responses are voluntary, they would be “useful” in helping it to build its case. Also, responses from investors could also lead to further questioning from the federal law agency, the website states.  BitConnect ran a crypto lending platform that was closed down in January 2018, after the firm was hit with various cease-and-desist orders from state securities regulators in both North Carolina and Texas, who claimed that the company was offering unregistered securities in the states. Both orders had a devastating effect on the coin, leading to the drastic erosion of the coin’s value. In January alone, the coin lost about 90 percent of its value, crashing from $400 to $20. Due to the sudden loss in value of BCC as well as the abrupt closure of the company’s platform, investors filed a class action suit against the company in a bid to claim back their lost funds. The suit was filed with the Southern District Court of Florida, and it alleged that BitConnect issued unregistered securities and then sought additional funds from the investors in a “wide-ranging Ponzi scheme.” According to the documents filed with the Court, the plaintiffs alleged that BitConnect launched a lending program that required its investors to send in crypto assets in exchange for the platform’s BCC token, and the company promised them either a 40 percent return on their investment or a 3,000 percent compounded annually. Per the document filed by plaintiffs, they argued that rather than using the funds sent in by investors for cryptocurrency trading, BitConnect ran an elaborate Ponzi scheme, paying existing investors with funds from new members. BitConnect Australia promoter and shareholder John Bigatton had his account frozen and a travel ban imposed on his movement by the Federal Court of Australia in January. The travel ban and fund freeze were put in motion by Australia’s financial regulator ASIC who started building its case against Bigatton since last December. The U.S. states of Illinois and Arizona also took steps to limit the activities of the promoters in India. The regulators urged the Indian Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to seize the assets of BitConnect promoters, suspected of raising around $5 billion from investors. So far, law enforcement officials in India have arrested the Indian head of BitConnect, Divyesh Darji. Darji, who was a resident of the city of Surat, already had a “look out” circular issued against him. He was eventually arrested at Delhi airport on August 18, 2018, after local immigration officers gave a tip-off to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Indian state of Gujarat police. As of now, the case against BitConnect is running as a single legal effort in the United States. Back in October 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida initiated an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint that also included additional promoters and owners of BitConnect whose names weren’t included in any previous lawsuits. The amended class action included a list of new defendants, including YouTube, which was sued for giving BitConnect’s promoters the ability to publish over 70,000 of content. The consolidated lawsuit called for a jury trial, and sought a remittance of all investments made by the plaintiffs. It also requested additional cash payments in damages.",

        "passage": "Ransomware isn’t playing around, and the malware that has notoriously terrorized multiple government agencies in the past seems to be setting its sights on another court system. A new report from local news medium 11 Alive revealed that the notorious ransomware had attacked the Administrative Offices of the Georgia Courts and knocked them offline. According to the report, the malware was employed by hackers to disrupt a portion of the court system’s digital information infrastructure, as authorities had to take swift action to prevent the damage from getting worse after they found a note from the supposed attackers.  Citing a statement from Administrative Office of the Court’s spokesman Bruce Shaw, the news outlet reports that the state agency’s IT department has taken down the entire network and are currently meeting with external agencies to determine the severity of the attack and work out a solution. While Shaw was unable to confirm why the court system was targeted, he did confirm that as of now, the Ransomware attack didn’t yield in any private information loss. However, given that the network is still down, Georgia citizens who would like to file court documents or deal with legal issues online would now have to go to the courts and address their cases in person. The current incident marks yet another case in the extending thread of instances where government and public institutions across the United States are being targeted in ransomware attacks. Just last month, the Riviera Beach City Council in Florida made $600,000 in ransom payments to hackers who overhauled their entire computer network. As part of the attack, the hackers took control of the City Council’s Email network system and blocked out all 911 dispatchers, preventing them from entering calls into their computers. According to multiple reports, the attackers sent a city employee an Email containing their malware. Upon opening it, the employee unwittingly gave the malware access to the city’s network, and hackers were all too happy with wreaking havoc. The City Council eventually held an emergency meeting and unanimously voted to yield to the hacker’s demands, wiring a $600,000 payment in the process. However, the most vicious ransomware attack in the past few years would have to be the SamSam attack on the city of Atlanta. Back in March 2018, the city dealt with the ransomware attack for weeks, as 5 of its 13 local governments were reportedly disrupted. The attack affected residents and government institutions like the courts and the police. Normalcy only returned after the city paid the criminals $50,000 as ransom. SamSam is ransomware on another level, known for its brutal efficiency. Unlike all other ransomware which spread through scams or phishing schemes that requires an unsuspecting victim to launch the malware on a single computer (thus starting a cascade of reactions that lead to a full-blown attack on a network), SamSam’s modus operandi is methodological. The ransomware checks for potential vulnerabilities (such as weak passwords or sub-standard security measures) in the target’s systems, then uses mechanisms like password discovery tools to completely overhaul the network. So, while other ransomware relies on clever tactics or social engineering to work, SamSam simply spots weaknesses on a network and finds ways to exploit them. So far, the method has worked out pretty well. A research report from security provider Symantec revealed that the hackers behind SamSam had attacked up to 67 organizations around the world last year alone. Attackers who deploy the ransomware are also known to select their targets- usual institutions like hospitals, large companies, government agencies, universities, etc., all of which would most likely prefer to immediately acquiesce to their ransom demands than bear the risk of prolonged downtime. Their price points are also known to be mutually beneficial; the target victims can pretty much afford them, and the attackers can smile to the bank after a hefty payday.",

        "passage": "There are no signs a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) will drop in America any time soon. But if the U.S.A. ever embraces crypto ETFs, they’ll undoubtedly have to play catch up with Europe, where willingness to embrace these products is building up steam more quickly. Such embraces have come into focus once more on the news that Swiss company Amun AG and U.S. investment firm Invesco are bringing new crypto and blockchain-centric exchange-traded products to market at Switzerland’s SIX stock exchange and the London Stock Exchange, respectively.  Amun first made waves in the cryptoverse last fall when it launched its so-called “HODL” crypto basket ETP, a type of ETF, on SIX. That basket, designed for monthly performance rebalances, started out tracking the prices of bitcoin, litecoin, ether, and XRP and has since gone on to enjoy considerable trade volume on the mainstream exchange. Now, the London-based Amun has confirmed it’s set its eyes on the imminent release of an XRP ETP as SIX has already approved the listing. The London company previously saw its ether ETP launch on the Swiss exchange earlier this month and its bitcoin ETP launch on SIX a few days prior to that. Rashwan noted that SIX had also granted approval for Amun ETPs tracking the prices of bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, and stellar lumens and that they would likely be released by year’s end. And ETPs that directly track the prices of cryptocurrencies aren’t the only kind of exchange-traded products capitalizing on the blockchain space in Europe. That’s because American investment play Invesco launched its Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain ETF on the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) today, March 11th. Invesco’s ETF doesn’t follow crypto prices but instead tracks the performance of nearly 50 companies directly or indirectly related to the blockchain space. Some of the firms eyed by the fund include bitcoin futures backers CME Group, miner manufacturing powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and chip and tech maestros IBM. The blockchain ETF comes as a partnership between Invesco and investment specialists Elwood Asset Management. The latter firm sourced the scoring methodology used for the selection of the companies in the fund. Upon the product’s launch on LESG, Elwood CEO Bin Ren argued that blockchain tech is starting to come into its own like the early internet once did: To date, a crypto-based ETF has yet to materialize in the U.S. over regulators’ concerns that the fledgling cryptoeconomy is still too prone to market manipulation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said it’s not interested in letting such manipulation bleed into mainstream American markets. But that conservative approach hasn’t stopped enterprises from attempting to be the first to gain SEC approval for a crypto ETF in America. In January 2019, Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) once again joined forces with financial services play SolidX and investment managers VanEck to resubmit their bitcoin ETF trust proposal to the SEC. The Commission will consider the proposal over the coming months. And January also saw the the filing of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF proposal with the SEC. Per its specs, the fund would track the price of bitcoin and “meaningful hard forks” of the OG cryptocurrency. It remains to be seen if either of these ETFs will be approved this year, however.",

        "passage": "Like it or not, crypto is used for crime. While mainstream media likely exaggerates their reports on Bitcoin-enabled crime, especially when they say everyone in the industry isn’t above board, these decentralized forms of money have found use in non-kosher scenarios. As reported by Blockonomi previously, Ciphertrace recently found that aggregate losses incurred by investors and firms due to cryptocurrency crime have reached $4.3 billion in the first half of 2019. A similar report from Chainalysis found that in 2019, dark web transactions made with Bitcoin, Monero, and other digital assets will amount to at least $1 billion.  On Thursday, Chainalysis, the blockchain analysis unit, unveiled a “Know Your Transaction (KYT) alerts” solution. The gist is to allow “cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions”, especially exchanges dealing with digital assets, to “mitigate exposure to regulatory and reputational risk by helping compliance teams focus on the most urgent activity and enforce compliance policies while better allocating resources.” So here’s how it works: when Chainalysis discovers a transfer/transaction that “involves a risky counterparty” and is of a suspicious value, it will send an alert to the client. To find questionable transactions, the firm will weigh the category of transaction, the parties on the end of the transaction, amount, direction of funds, among other factors to determine what level of alert to send out. Alerts are available for 15 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, and some ERC-20 tokens. John Dempsey, VP of Product, Chainalysis, accentuated the importance of KYT alerts in a press statement: While it isn’t clear which firms, agencies, or individuals will be adopting KYT alerts from the get-go, there’s one great and pertinent use case that this writer has thought off: deterring the laundering of funds gained through PlusToken. For those who missed the memo, PlusToken is an Asia-centric crypto scam that has purportedly gathered billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and other digital assets. Recently, the founders of the scheme, which marketed the project as a wallet that generated high-yield returns, exited, attempting to run away with a purported 200,000+ BTC and nearly one million ETH stash. Six ringleaders were caught, but the scheme’s known addresses continue to see outflows. Industry commentator and investor Dovey Wan has claimed that PlusToken’s remaining team members are sending “50 to 100 BTC” blocks to exchanges to presumably cash out and live on the stolen funds. Of course, exchanges don’t want to be an accessory in laundering PlusToken’s ill-gotten capital — hence KYT alerts. Chainalysis’s product release is actually quite timely. Per previous reports from Blockonomi, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC this week that anonymous/pseudonymous transactions that cryptocurrencies can enable do pose a security threat or “risk” to America and its allies. To back his point, the Secretary of State cited the 9/11 attacks, which is something that Congressman Brad Sherman did to bash Libra last month: Pompeo thus argued that “electronic financial transactions” should be regulated by the same laws that preside over a global payments platform like SWIFT. Chainalysis’s latest product is likely to help with such regulation. So while KYT alerts aren’t the end all and be all of cryptocurrency surveillance and regulation, it is a step in the right direction in the eyes of global governments.",

        "passage": "Social media has become a powerful force across the globe. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are go-to destinations for news and information. Very little oversight exists for companies that have become a vital part of information distribution around the world. In addition to the ethical issues that arise from these platforms, there are still many gray areas where blockchain could help how content is monetized. A platform like Facebook or Snapchat is basically a way for people to easily share content. The platform does little to create anything, but they are able to realize substantial gains from their users. People that post their photos, videos and other media are creating marketable entertainment for the platforms. However the content creators aren’t given much in the way of compensation for their efforts.  Even a platform like YouTube that allows content creators to realize some amount of profit from their work has the ability to ‘demonetize’ content at will. The platform still gains from the content, because they show ads during a demonetized video. Users and content creators are at the mercy of the platforms, but blockchain could be a part of finding a solution to this problem. Alex Jones has gone on the record with some wild statements. Whatever a person might feel about the positions that Alex Jones has taken, it would be wise to pay attention to what could be a terrifying precedence. Within a week, the outspoken Texan was banned from every major content platform. There is little he can do to regain use of the world’s largest media distribution systems. It all comes down to corporate policy, not law. Alex Jones did nothing illegal, and yet, he can’t post videos to sites that he helped generate countless dollars in ad revenue for over many years. Not only is he banned from continued use, but his entire oeuvre has been chucked into the ‘memory hole’. Needless to say, this isn’t good for content creators. There should be no argument that a platform like Facebook realizes massive profits from its infrastructure. Regardless of the costs involved, it is clear that content distribution platforms create value. The issue now is how that profit is shared, and blockchain can put the power of profit back in the hands of the creatives. The Alex Jones affair shines a light on a much larger problem that creatives face today. While accessing content has never been easier, getting paid to create isn’t straightforward. Platforms like YouTube and Facebook have become rich from freely offered content, but blockchain could the technology that allows creatives to cut out the middleman. Blockchain-based record keeping systems allow huge amounts of data to be recorded with no intermediaries. In the realm of social media and content sharing, this means platforms like YouTube could easily be replaced by cloud-computing nodes. There are also new advertising platforms that use blockchain to record where adverts are shown, and who is paying attention to them. Contentos is marketing their COS token, which they designed to create a scalable marketplace for online content distribution. The idea is more or less to connect content producers with media consumers directly, though they don’t have a platform that could challenge YouTube or Facebook. They have created the ability for other companies to participate in their ecosystem, so if a tokenized content distribution model becomes popular, they could be worth watching. Snapparazzi is taking a different approach, and uses blockchain to help creatives that want to sell pictures of newsworthy events. Their platform will allow creatives to upload their pictures and videos, and news platforms can bid on them. The buyers will pay in fiat, and the creatives will receive SnapCoin tokens, which may dissuade established journalists from using the new platform. Regardless of the financials, Snapparazzi does seem to be a step in the right direction for creatives. Although blockchain hasn’t been used to create a rival to Facebook or YouTube yet, there are platforms that are going in that direction. When people realize the benefits that blockchain creates in terms of safety for personal information and oversight, it is likely they will prefer blockchain-based social media.",

        "passage": "It looks like more big names are coming to the world of blockchain testing in the real world. Reuters reports that Harvard University and The Levi Strauss Company will be teaming up to test a blockchain-powered platform they think could replace external factory health and safety auditors. Blockchain healthcare platforms are also on the rise. Harvard and Levi’s will be teaming up with New America think tank, and deploying the new system into three of Levi’s factories in Mexico. The goal is to create a solid record of health and safety in industrial settings, and remove the inconsistencies that are associated with human auditors.  The director of Harvard T.H. Chan’s Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise, Dr. Eileen McNeely, commented that, “For the last 25 years, work in supply chains has been monitored mainly by audits… A distributed system of inquiry on the blockchain that goes right to the source offers a new solution.” The initial testing will comprise 5,000 workers and could lead to much wider usage of the system if it is successful. The blockchain that will be used in the pilot program is being designed by ConsenSys. Joseph Lubin founded ConsenSys, and was also one of Ethereum’s (ETH) original developers. There are many areas where blockchain could be applied to healthcare. Blockchain’s ability to create independent records could lead to greater levels of data sharing, with greater efficiencies realized between industry and healthcare providers. IBM and PNC Bank are teaming up with Aetna, Anthem, and Health Care Service Corporation to look for ways that blockchain could make a difference in healthcare. The companies stated that, “The aim is to create an inclusive blockchain network that can benefit multiple members of the healthcare ecosystem in a secure, shared environment…The goal is to allow the blockchain network to enable healthcare companies to build, share and deploy solutions that drive digital transformation in the industry,” in a recent announcement. The first phase of their collaboration will be a ‘health utility network’, which will work to identify use cases which blockchain can be used to secure the exchange if healthcare data. Healthcare records are extremely important, but the shift to Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) has been troublesome. Many doctors have complained about the process of entering data, and the lack of efficiencies in the EHR platforms. Aetna is one of the largest managed care companies in the USA. Its Chief Technology Officer, Claus Jensen, said that, ”We are committed to improving the healthcare consumer experience and making our healthcare system work more effectively,” and also, “Through the application of blockchain technology, we’ll work to improve data accuracy for providers, regulators, and other stakeholders, and give our members more control over their own data.” Healthcare providers are facing rising costs. The population in the USA needs to have better access to care, without it costing more than it does already. The five companies involved in the venture are hoping that blockchain can make administrative activities more efficient, and also make data more accurate. Chris Ward, the Head of Product at PNC Treasury Management, commented that, “This alliance will enable healthcare-related data and business transactions to occur in way that addresses market demands for transparency and security, while making it easier for the patient, payer and provider to handle payments” and that, “Using this technology, we can remove friction, duplication, and administrative costs that continue to plague the industry.” It is easy to see that blockchain development is catching on in a big way. Lori Steele, who is IBM’s General Manager for Healthcare and Life Sciences, said that, “Blockchain’s unique attributes make it suitable for large networks of members to quickly exchange sensitive data in a permissioned, controlled, and transparent way,” and that, “The fact that these major healthcare players have come together to collaborate indicates the value they see in working together to explore new models that we think could drive more efficiency in the healthcare system and ultimately improve the patient experience.” It would be hard to imagine a more glowing endorsement of a new technology than that. Hopefully, these efforts help industry to create better records and also keep healthcare costs as affordable as possible.",

        "passage": "We just can’t seem to get away from phony initial coin offerings (ICOs). A former businessman turned cryptocurrency enthusiast in Brooklyn is facing up to five years in prison for organizing two fake ICOs in 2017.  ICOs, though still relatively new, remain a popular way for new businesses and startups to garner capital for their operations. Through an ICO, business ventures can garner funds – usually via ether tokens – from investors who in return, are granted special access to an entirely new coin developed by the business in question. Investors can then utilize this coin to gain access to the company’s products and services. It’s a straightforward give some, take some partnership between the funder and the funded. But sometimes, greed and avarice take over one’s initial business dealings, and over the past year, many of these ICOs and similar funding methods have turned out to be fake. 2018 has proven to be a huge year for phony ICOs. Thus far, over $500 million has been lost to ICOs that up and disappear once they start. Investors are usually left with lighter pockets, damaged pride, and a handful of enterprise-based tokens they can no longer use. In this case, the fraudster goes by the name of Maksim Zaslavskiy, a former institutional developer and self-appointed “businessman.” Zaslavskiy pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in front of a New York judge on Thursday, November 15, 2018. He also confessed to defrauding about 1,000 separate investors with a cryptocurrency called RECoin, the first digital asset to allegedly be backed by real estate listings. In addition, Zaslavskiy claims to have sold special “diamond” tokens that were purportedly backed by real, physical diamonds. Both claims – along with the tokens being advertised – were fake, as there are no blockchains powering them. U.S. district attorney Richard Donague explained in an interview: Court documents claim that Zaslavskiy told his investors RECoin had a “team of lawyers, professionals, brokers and accountants” behind it, and that roughly 2.8 million separate tokens had been individually sold up to that point. In truth, RECoin had only attracted about 1,000 investors. FBI assistant director-in-charge William Sweeney explained that Zaslavskiy and his associates “dressed old-fashioned criminal schemes in the language of new currency” to garner funds they didn’t earn and had no rights to from unsuspecting (and new) investors. The judge overseeing the case issued a warning to the crypto industry, saying that simply labeling something a digital asset does not make it money, and that using the term “cryptocurrency” will not give phony initiatives any special leeway. He commented that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on all fraudulent cryptocurrency projects, and those looking to defraud their investors should expect heavy consequences. Aside from a potential five-year prison sentence, Zaslavskiy is also facing civil charges from the SEC. These charges will be settled once the court decides on a proper sentence. A similar story occurred recently on the opposite side of the country when on November 9, 2018, Joseph Kim in Arizona was fined approximately $1.1 million and given a 15-month prison sentence for allegedly running phony bitcoin and Litecoin schemes against several investors including, his former employer. Court documents report that Kim had misappropriated his employer’s funds between the months of September and November of 2017. During this time, Kim was working at a Chicago-based trading firm. He secretly transferred the company’s tokens from the exchange into his own wallet, then left his position with the company to go out and solicit investors.",

AI development has become more popular over the last few years. Algos like Amazon’s Alexa are entering mainstream consumer culture. People are getting used to having AI assistants, and using AI for numerous daily activities. There are probably going to be more algos that will enter the consumer space, and they could help people with everything from language translation to saving energy at home. DBC tokens can be used to purchase processing power on the AI Training Net, which will also be how their full platform monetizes computing power. DeepBrain Chain already has numerous AI and Machine-Learning (ML) programs running on its AI Training Net. Algos that specialize in Natural Language Processing, driverless cars, medical imaging, and voice recognition are reportedly using the AI Training Net. DeepBrain Chain’s platform offers optimized operations on top of CUDA GPUs to support popular deep-learning frameworks, like TensorFlow, CNTK and Caffe.  Read: Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Blockchain: Thinking Our Way to a Brighter Future? In addition to creating a platform that helps others to develop AI and ML algos, DeepBrain Chain is working to implement an AI system that would work with smart-grid technology to cut waste. The company recently made an investment in EtainPower to further this goal. EtainPower is developing a system that would allow straightforward peer-to-peer trading of electricity via smart-contracts. EtainPower’s platform is still in its early stages, but they join numerous other companies that see the potential for blockchain to cut energy waste. The University of Fudan just announced the patent of a system that works towards the same goal, and Walmart has also patented a competing technology. All three systems approach the goal in different ways, but all rely on the transactional efficiency that blockchain brings to micro-payments and record keeping. The full potential of smart-grid technology will probably only be realized with a highly efficient settlement system, like blockchain. Elevated transactional costs represent inefficiency, and AI can help to best use electricity if it isn’t hindered by an outdated financial system. There are overlaps in energy and finance which are important to consider. When energy is wasted, there is an amount of financial waste that will happen as well. AI and smart-grid technology can help both consumers and businesses eliminate wasted power, which has the potential to radically change how electrical systems are designed. It would be next to impossible for a human planner to monitor millions of separate electrical devices, but AI can handle big data easily. That is probably why major corporations like Walmart are looking at blockchain-based micro-payment systems, and working to roll out a platform that would allow a level of oversight that wasn’t possible before. DeepBrain Chain has the potential to help smaller companies and universities develop AI and ML platforms that wouldn’t be able to access a development space otherwise. DeepBrain Chain raised more than $11 million USD late last year, and is working on distributing tokens to universities and other research institutions.",

        "passage": "Looking to buy citizenship in another country, but you’re only bitcoin rich? The island nation of Antigua may have just the ticket for you. According to news reports, the parliament of Antigua and Barbuda have changed their “Citizenship by Investment Programme Act” so that those seeking citizenship in the nation can do so in bitcoin. A number of nations offer so-called investment programs as a way to gain citizenship, including a number of first world and Western countries. Typically, the goal of these types of programs is to encourage wealthy or high net worth individuals to invest in the country either by buying property or operating a business venture, or just paying a one time fee. This is a very common practice in a number of small island nations in particular.  One classic example of this as it relates to cryptocurrency specifically is the infamous Bitcoin Cash proponent, Roger Ver. Ver gave up his US citizenship (and happily so, according to a number of interviews he’s given) and has since taken up residence at the island nation of St. Kitts. All he had to do in order to secure citizenship was to buy a house there, most likely as part of a real estate investment for citizenship program. For those that don’t know, Antigua is an island nation located in the Caribbean. With an estimated population of 80,000, the country is unique in that it is one of the earliest nations to legalize online gambling. The nation is home to a vast number of picturesque crystal beaches and warm, satiny sands. 365, to be exact. So what will a passport to this exotic location cost you? Depending on the type of investment program used to gain citizenship, it will cost you (at today’s prices) right around 12.2 bitcoin. In other words, that’s a minimum application of $100,000 by using the national development fund scheme. According to the official site for the program, the NDF is a “non-profit fund that is subject to parliamentary oversight by way of a six monthly report to be presented to Parliament in sufficient detail to allow for transparency and accountability.” There could be a number of answers for that. One could be in a case like Roger Ver where issues relating to taxation and a general anti-government stance could drive you to seek safer harbors. It could be an attempt to restart one’s life, or to establish a business that is not subject to strict laws, such as an online gambling business. And of course, getting a passport at a nation like Antigua does not mean that you need to give up the citizenship of your home country, assuming that your own country will allow for dual citizenship. The United States and Canada, for example, allow for dual citizenship. However, a number of other nations like China and Singapore do not. So before you get your bitcoin ready, you may want to consider whether or not you will have to, or if you want to give up your passport. If you are wealthy enough that your annual or multi-year tax burden exceeds $100,000, it sure could make sense to try to move your dealings to a nation where the tax demands won’t be quite so steep. Plus, having 365 tropical beaches within a short distance, or even right outside your bedroom window if you’re lucky enough, doesn’t hurt either.",

        "passage": "On February 19th, powerhouse U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced its acquisition of Neutrino, a blockchain intelligence play whose enterprise-grade tools for “tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains” will now be used for and on America’s largest crypto user base to date. Originally headquartered in Milan, Italy, Neutrino will shift over its operations to the American exchange’s London office while maintaining its status as an independent enterprise within the Coinbase ecosystem. The exchange’s leadership hailed the move as another step it’s taking to mature and legitimize the cryptoeconomy.  “By analyzing data on public blockchains, Neutrino will help us prevent theft of funds from peoples’ accounts, investigate ransomware attacks, and identify bad actors,” Coinbase’s engineering head Varun Srinivasan said on the news. Under the Coinbase umbrella, Neutrino’s eight employees will help with cybersecurity and theft investigations, and the startup’s ICO monitoring services may be used as the exchange considers expanding its token offerings. In December 2018, Coinbase declared it was considering as many as 30 new cryptocurrencies to its platform. Toward the daylight of the mainstream, the buy-up will organize the exchange’s operations and will sit well with U.S. regulators, legislators, and traditional finance players. On the flip side, the more anarchic among the cryptoeconomy’s diehards will see the acquisition as another advancing threat against the privacies afforded by pseudonymous blockchain use. As the cryptoverse has blossomed, the demand for blockchain analysis services has grown in kind. And as the ecosystem now has its first decade under its belt with possibilities for further growth on the horizon, the demand for these niche intelligence services is reaching a fever pitch. Coinbase reportedly started working on its own proprietary market surveillance system back in 2018. It’s growing demand that drove the recent $30 million USD Series B fundraising round of Chainalysis, the space’s most high-profile blockchain investigation firm. The company said it was using part of those funds to open up a permanent office in London, so with Chainalysis and Neutrino in town, the U.K. capital looks set to become an international blockchain intelligence hub. Moreover, the Neutrino acquisition also indicates Coinbase’s pivoting focus to Europe and its crypto centers. As the exchange has built out its London operations, it’s also looked elsewhere in Europe, having announced the opening of an office in Dublin, Ireland, last fall. The company first received a Barclays bank account and an e-money license to operate in the U.K. last spring. Coinbase has continued to expand through acquisitions at a steady pace, regardless of the cryptoeconomy downturn after the 2017 bull run. This January, the U.S. exchange acquired Californian data collection startup Blockspring, which, like Neutrino, was slotted to remain as an independent company leveraged within the wider Coinbase ecosystem. In 2018, the company went on a purchasing spree, buying up dapp browswer Cipher Browser, crypto earnings play Earn.com, securities dealer Keystone Capital, decentralized exchange Paradex, and digital identity upstart Distributed Systems. Individually, each of these acquisitions suggests Coinbase isn’t interested in being just a straightforward cryptocurrency exchange. Taken altogether, the buy-ups indicate the exchange is building out the infrastructure for a sprawling brand ecosystem in the years ahead, which will be underpinned though and through by blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. And as it builds, Coinbase does so from its war chest. The company raised an impressive $300 million USD in its Series E fundraising round in October 2018.",

        "passage": "Many in the crypto community were shocked in June when Facebook unveiled the firms backing Libra — Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Coinbase, Xapo, and countless other pro-innovation companies and investors. While the marketing material — which showed the Libra emblem enclosed by the logos of the aforementioned companies — made it seem like these partners are concretely part of Libra, there have been some doubts thrown around.  An executive of PayPal, who is effectively investing in a competitor by getting involved with Libra, recently came out to issue comments about the project, marking somewhat of a blow to the project amid already intense times for Libra. According to a report from the AFP published this weekend, PayPal isn’t 100% convinced Libra will become the money of the future. The fintech giant’s investor relations vice president, Gabrielle Rabinovitch, asserted that should PayPal reconsider, their involvement in the Libra Association is technically a “non-binding commitment”. Indeed, as reported by this outlet previously, the CEO of Visa said that what his firm signed with Libra is a “non-binding letter of intent”, meaning that “no one has yet officially joined”. Even the head of Facebook’s blockchain ambitions, PayPal alumnus David Marcus, has admitted that Libra partners reserve the right to pull their support. Rabinovitch, notably, didn’t even hint that PayPal is looking to make a dash for the door. But, she asserted that there is “a lot of work” that needs to be completed before Libra is anything more than “just a very exciting idea”. PayPal isn’t the only Libra Association member to have cast some doubt on the cryptocurrency. Previously, the Financial Times reported that three of the Libra Association’s members have been considering leaving the consortium. One of the executives of the skeptical firms said that Libra will put a strain on partners looking to maintain regulatory compliance. Some firms might want out, but others want in, specifically firms native to the crypto industry. The most notable of these Libra-curious firms is Gemini, the firm founded by Zuckerberg’s rivals, the Winklevoss Twins. The brothers said in a CNN interview that they have an active line with Libra’s team, but are currently waiting on more information about the project before pulling the trigger. Crypto infrastructure provider Bitcoin.com, previously led by Roger Ver, has also hinted at its interest in Libra. In a recent video published to the Bitcoin.com Youtube channel, Roger Ver said that his company has been in contact with Libra. There has been also of some involvement in Libra by Asian-centric cryptocurrency firms, namely Japanese exchange CoinCheck and Taiwanese exchange MaiCoin. Binance earlier this year said that it was also interested. However, the firm did a recent 180°, launching its own stablecoin project — the also-astrologically named Venus — to compete with Libra. All this comes at a very interesting turning point in Libra’s short but widely-covered lifespan. Last week, regulators in both France and Germany formally revealed moves to ban the development and launch of Libra in the European Union, echoing the line of U.S. politician Maxine Waters across the pond. On Monday, representatives from the world’s central banks met in Switzerland to meet with Libra, presumably to discuss the potential monetary and criminal risks involved in the revolutionary cryptocurrency project. Despite all this volatility internally and externally, key members in the whole Libra equation have still expressed their optimism.

        "passage": "Another Bitcoin-based blackmail attempt has been discovered and was reported by ABC7 News in San Francisco last week. The potential victim received a letter in the mail demanding bitcoin in exchange for silence on alleged improprieties. But according to the receiver of the letter, he has nothing to worry about since the threat is obviously fake.  San Francisco resident Daniel Levinson received a letter in the mail claiming to be from a professional hacker calling themselves “BlackDoor-82”. The hacker claimed to have sensitive information that Levinson would not want his wife to know about. The hacker then claimed that this information came about through a job in San Francisco that then went into some deeper digging and eventually revealed what the hacker claims are the potential victim’s “misadventures”. In exchange for what the BlackDoor-82 calls a “confidentiality fee” of $8150, they claim they will not reveal the information they supposedly have. This fee must be paid in bitcoin. Interestingly enough, ABC7 News reported that the blackmail letter included a 19-step instruction guide for how to buy and send the cryptocurrency. Speaking to ABC7 News, Levinson said that he knew immediately that the letter was fake. After spending some time thinking, Levinson realized that there was nothing in his life that he would not want his wife to know about. The way the letter was phrased seemed intentionally vague. It does not claim that Levinson did anything specific, such as having an affair, a secret drinking problem, a gambling problem, or anything else. If the threat letter was real, it would likely include very specific details about true events in order to convince the potential victim that the threat was serious. Levinson’s wife Nora said that she found the letter “disturbing but also funny,” and that she had no concerns or doubts about her husband and his behavior in the past. This event is far from the first time that a would-be blackmailer demand payment through cryptocurrency. Blackmail letters of this type have been appearing for some years now. In 2016, writer Dave Eargle wrote of an event where he received a similar blackmail letter demanding bitcoin payment in exchange for silence. In Eargle’s case, the demand was for $2000 in Bitcoin. Eargle did his own research and found that the letter he received was very similar to one that was allegedly tied to the Ashley Madison hack. That letter, which was shared by GrahamCluley.com, a computer security news site, was sent out to an unknown number of people at random and also demanded $2000 in Bitcoin. Those blackmail letters went out in mid-to-late 2015, which is when the hack was a hot topic.  What’s also interesting to note is that while many of these blackmail letters were spread via email, this recent set of attacks has been done through the Postal Service on printed letters. This was perhaps done as a way to make the threat appear more realistic or terrifying. While emails can be mass fired off to an infinite number of addresses at random, sending physically printed letters in the mail requires quite a bit more care and attention, as well as cost for the much higher Postal Service fees. As a result, however, the blackmail letter not only shows more care and attention went into making the threat, but also that the person making the threat allegedly has the potential victim’s home address. As cryptocurrencies provide for an easy way to send large sums of money anonymously, these sorts of threats and scams will likely continue into the foreseeable future. This is especially true as more and more people become familiar with cryptocurrencies, and become more likely to have them on hand. In the early days of the Internet and even to a lesser extent the past few years, email fraud such as the infamous advance fee fraud or 419 scam cost victims millions of dollars. Perhaps cryptocurrency-fueled blackmail or other forms of fraud will be the next wave of attack that individuals will need to protect themselves from. Luckily, all it takes to remain safe is to simply not fall for the lies. It goes without saying, but if you yourself receive such a blackmail letter, you should report it to the police or other relevant authorities as soon as possible.",

        "passage": "Ivy League institution Yale University is investing in Paradigm, a cryptocurrency hedge fund founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, and Pantera Capital veteran Charles Noyes. Yale’s endowment is the second-largest in higher education and is run by David Swenson, a world-class investment manager that began Yale’s endowment with a “meager” $1 billion.  Hedge fund giant turned crypto enthusiast Mike Novogratz broke the news on Twitter, writing: Paradigm has now raised a whopping $400 million, and shares the limelight with such ventures as Pantera, Polychain Capital and Andreesen Horowitz as one of the largest investment funds devoted to the cryptocurrency space. In addition, it is being reported that Swenson also invested money in Andreesen Horowitz’s cryptocurrency fund – which currently exceeds $300 million – back in June. The firm later explained: Yale’s endowment stands at just shy of $30 billion, of which roughly 60 percent is devoted to “alternative investments” such as cryptocurrencies. The university has also managed to return a rough average of about 7.5 percent, beating the average university endowment return by approximately two percent. John Lore – founder of the Capital Fund Law group – suggested earlier this year that educational institutions should start investing in cryptocurrency ventures on a “limited basis for strategic reasons,” and it appears Yale is taking this advice to heart. At press time, it’s unclear how much money Yale offered to Paradigm and Andreesen Horowitz; in fact, the news hasn’t even been confirmed publicly. However, Ari Paul – chief investment officer at BlockTower Capital – says the amounts of money offered aren’t going to matter. He states that since Yale has gotten the ball rolling, other endowments are likely to follow suit, and he’s certain more schools will be entering the cryptocurrency space: He goes on to say that the day bitcoin and cryptocurrency-based hedge funds become fully legitimate will be when people trust enough to pour their retirement savings and pension funds into them, though he admits this isn’t likely to happen for some time, the biggest reason being the small amount of regulated cryptocurrency custodians among respected Wall Street figures. However, it has been reported that roughly three of the world’s largest banks – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup – have either started or completed plans for various custody products for cryptocurrencies. Also, Bakkt – the digital currency trading platform established by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – is set to make its official debut next month and will offer physical warehousing for bitcoin. This will allow institutions to trade in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies through a regulated environment under the lens of one of the world’s largest exchange operators. Swenson has been managing Yale’s endowment for 33 years. His success with the school is unprecedented and has caught the eye of neighboring Ivy League institutions such as Princeton, Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, all of which have adopted his investment strategies.",

        "passage": "According to a report published by Harry Denley, a security researcher for wallet provider MyCrypto, there has been a mismatch in the security keys used by paper wallet creator WalletGenerator. The post revealed that WalletGenerator had been deploying faulty codes as far back as August 2018, before patching the bug on May 23, 2019.  The report clarified that ideally, the site should have an open-source code that is available on GitHub, and the keys generated on the website’s live version should be generated randomly. However, after testing the live code, certain discrepancies were noticed between the public and private keys- most significantly, the fact that the platform was handing out identical private keys to multiple users. Denley and his team of researchers went on to test the website using the “Bulk Wallet” generator, and they discovered that after 1,000 key-generation efforts, the GitHub version of the site returned 1,000 unique keys. However, the keys returned by the live code were just 120. These results were sustained, even after the team changed their VPNs and browsers used to run the test. The researchers decided to contact WalletGenerator about the potential vulnerability, and while the latter didn’t seem interested in their claims, Denley noted that the problem seemed to have been patched. Denley went on to recommend that all WalletGenerator users who created their wallets after August 17, 2018, should move their funds to other platforms for the security of their funds, adding that while it seemed that the issue had been rectified, there’s always a possibility of it being re-introduced. At press time, WalletGenerator is yet to issue a statement on the issue. While a report such as this could serve as an indictment of paper wallets, it’s worth noting that hardware wallets- their chief alternatives- aren’t so secure as well. Earlier this year, hardware wallet provider Ledger published a report where it detailed vulnerabilities in the devices manufactured by Trezor, one of its chief competitors. According to the study, the vulnerabilities were discovered by Attack Lab, a department at the firm which launches attacks on devices owned by the company and its competitors to identify weaknesses. Ledger revealed issues with the Trezor One and Trezor T wallets, such as the presence of a backdoor protocol, which would allow would-be imitators to make fake, malware-infested devices. Other vulnerabilities include the possibility of stealing confidential information right from Trezor’s devices, as well as sub-standard counter-attack measures contained in the crypto library of the Trezor One device. In a rebuttal statement, Trezor pointed out that none of the weaknesses discovered by Ledger were critical to the hardware wallets themselves. According to the company, it was impossible for any of the vulnerabilities to be exploited remotely, as the would-be attackers would require “physical access to the device, specialized equipment, time, and technical expertise.” Trezor pointed out the result of a survey done in association with crypto wallet Binance, which revealed that 66 percent of users believe that remote wallet attacks are the main problem. In addition, Trezor highlighted that a $5 wrench attack– a form of theft where a user is compelled to disclose his password- can’t be prevented by the manufacturer’s hardware barriers. Regardless, the probability of attacking a Trezor wallet is still relatively small.",

        "passage": "Enjin is teaming up with Japanese accelerator HashPort and will work to promote adoption of Enjin’s blockchain solutions in the Japanese market. HashPort will act as a business development agent for Enjin, which is developing an ecosystem of blockchain-based products and services for gaming, which are fuelled by a cryptocurrency. Japan is a massive market for gaming. It is estimated to be the third-largest market for games and has a population of more than 125 million people, making the country a perfect fit for Enjin’s blockchain game development platform.  Unlike many nations, Japan is also very open to using cryptocurrencies and has an existing base for crypto exchanges, as well as gaming. In addition to helping connect Enjin with potential adopters of the Enjin Platform, HashPort will also look to build business relationships and assist with getting Enjin Coin (ENJ) listed on Japanese exchanges. In addition to having a huge population of video game enthusiasts, Japan is one of the biggest forces in the global gaming community. When a popular product emerges in the Japanese gaming market, it could very well be on its way to taking the world by storm. From the original Nintendo console system to Pokémon GO, the game designs that Japan creates have been an extraordinary influence on global culture for decades. That trend is set to continue, and blockchain stands to play a major role in the next chapter of gaming history. Enjin is getting into a lot more than a new customer base with its entry to Japan. In fact, it could help to embed the ERC-1155 token into the global gaming market, as every asset minted with the Enjin Platform is an ERC-1155 token backed by Enjin Coin. Created by Enjin CTO alongside a community of Github developers, ERC-1155 recently reached final status and was adopted by the Ethereum community as the accepted standard for minting fungible and non-fungible assets. One of the biggest advantages of ERC-1155 is that it allows developers to mint an unlimited number of both fungible (identical) and non-fungible (unique) assets in a single smart contract. ERC-1155 tokens are also powerful in that they can be used across numerous games and platforms (which Enjin refers to as the “Multiverse”) while maintaining unique qualities. Enjin is working to launch the Enjin Platform to Ethereum Mainnet. After the launch, more than 25 million software developers from around the world will be able to use Enjin Coin to mint ERC-1155 tokens and integrate them into whatever they choose. If Japanese game developers are able to popularize the use of ERC-1155 tokens in the domestic market, a greater presence in the global gaming market could follow. Big game developers have been resistant to allowing the use of unique items that exist in a decentralized way, as it removes their ability to control the game environment. Gamers win big when they have ownership and control over their digital stash, and that could be the next big step in gaming. HashPort Accelerator Founder Seihaku Yoshida commented that: Yoshida appears to understand that blockchain creates huge opportunities for game developers who are open to its adoption and may also create competitive advantages for the Japanese gaming industry, as its developers work to adopt a technology that developers in other countries have not yet caught on to. The use of unique tokens represents a major shift in how digital property is owned. It won’t take gamers long to figure out that it is much better to actually own your items, than trust a company with all of your digital goods. Earlier this year, Enjin launched its Testnet version of its blockchain game development platform, and it has already attracted more than 7,000 users. The platform that allows people to create, manage, and integrate ERC-1155 tokens into their games, apps, and websites, while empowering users with true ownership of their unique digital tokens. The gaming market is a perfect place for ERC-1155 blockchain assets to gain more traction, and Enjin is likely making a good move by entering the Japanese market with the help of HashPort. ERC-1155 tokens have applications that extend well beyond gaming, so it will be interesting to see what happens over the next year or two as Japanese developers begin adopting the Enjin Platform. There is a growing need for decentralized options in the gaming space, and it appears that Enjin is securing a place for itself in one of the best places for development globally.",

        "passage": "Major exchange Coinbase has just announced that they will soon be offering Ethereum Classic services including buying and selling for fiat currency. A number of respondents on Twitter seem confused and furious that Ripple’s XRP was not chosen. Ethereum Classic fans, on the other hand, are ecstatic. ETC prices jumped 20% following the announcement.  According to the official Coinbase blog post, the company will begin engineering work on adding the coin shortly. Following this, they plan to announce the launch date for trading through their blog and Twitter account. This announcement should come “over the next few months”. This process is notably different than when Bitcoin Cash was added. At that time, a sudden announcement was met with a sudden listing of the asset and the price exploding upwards about an hour before the announcement. This led to accusations of insider trading, which the company promised to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators if any are found. With this new process, company is announcing its intentions to support the asset well in advance of actually doing so. This will allow the market a significant amount of time to mentally prepare for the potentially increased interest in the asset. Following the announcement, trading prices for Ethereum Classic sharply increased and just minutes after 9:20 AM UTC on June 12, prices jumped from $12.88 to a high of $16.15 before slumping back slightly to $15.36 at press time. This is indeed a far cry from what happened with Bitcoin Cash. For those unfamiliar with Ethereum Classic and how it differs from Ethereum, we recommend you take a look at our guide on the subject here. With that in mind, let’s go over some of the recent activity that Ethereum classic has seen.  First, the currency has a very active and well-funded development team that is constantly pushing new technical innovations. In addition, the currency appears to have a highly effective marketing team that recently relaunched all Ethereum classic imagery and branding to one that is much more visually appealing. The currency has also seen growing support from Grayscale, an investment firm that has taken a very strong position in Ethereum classic. Grayscale has been actively funding a series of events called the Ethereum Classic Summit where developers, investors, and business leaders get together in a conference and discuss where the platform is going. Last year’s event was held in Hong Kong, and this year’s event will be held in South Korea. Grayscale also runs an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust, which can be read about here. From a technical perspective, Ethereum Classic is in some ways superior to the original Ethereum. That could be simply because it is a less busy blockchain, for whatever reason transaction fees are well below one cent USD and confirm in just a few seconds. The platform supports all types of smart contracts that Ethereum supports, and even has some unique features of its own that Ethereum does not. What’s also interesting is that Ethereum Classic has chosen to continue being a proof-of-work coin and is not interested in switching to proof-of-stake as Ethereum is. This could be important given that there is now ASIC hardware designed to mine the algorithm that Ethereum Classic runs on. This could cause former Ethereum miners to flood over to Ethereum Classic if the chain continues to be profitable as it is now.  For months now, many commentators have been predicting that the next asset to be added by Coinbase would be Ripple’s XRP. Most commentators believe that because Ripple has made great efforts to appeal to banks and corporations that a company like Coinbase would be interested in it. There are a few possibilities for why Coinbase may have chosen to avoid XRP this time around. One could be the current ongoing class action lawsuit that Ripple is facing in regards to allegations that the currency can be pulled “out of thin air“, and is essentially a never-ending ICO, and is not subject to normal market forces as a result. Further, Ripple’s XRP coin has still seen no formal adoption by any corporation or bank despite its boasting and claims of being superior. Finally there could perhaps be technical reasons on the back and. XRP has been accused of being comparatively centralized as it does not have any form of mining or staking, and instead only offers approved parties to operate nodes that propagate transactions. These reasons could have created a number of technical problems that Coinbase did not want to get involved in. This is just speculation, however, as Coinbase has not made any comment in regards to XRP itself.  While we can’t predict the future or prices, essentially every asset that has been listed on Coinbase has seen strong and consistent gains. Litecoin and Ethereum, for example, both experienced significant price jumps following their listings on Coinbase. The reason for this in part is because Coinbase offers a very convenient way for investors to sell their investments for cash, and it also is typically the first stop for many people new to cryptocurrency as it is a fairly straightforward way to buy it. Adding Ethereum classic to the service will most likely prove to have similar results at least to some degree. This is yet to be seen however, but it’s safe to say that Ethereum Classic’s future just got a whole lot brighter thanks to this announcement.",

        "passage": "Another wrinkle of intrigue hitting the buzzing cryptoeconomy this week is the news that mainstream payments powerhouse PayPal has confirmed an investment into a rising Massachusetts blockchain startup. The move notably marks an inaugural direct foray into the distributed ledger ecosystem for the high-profile former eBay spin-off. That startup, Cambridge Blockchain, is an identity management play that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate identity compliance solutions for institutions.  PayPal was tight-lipped on their confirmation of the Series A investment, with a company spokesperson telling CoinDesk that Cambridge Blockchain’s work seemed poised to be fruitful going forward. The two companies aren’t strangers, either. PayPal’s sponsorship of the Fintech Europe 2018 accelerator campaign led to the firm’s first contacts with Cambridge Blockchain, who were participants in that event. Those contacts eventually evolved to the point where the startup started working with PayPal’s venture arm, PayPal Ventures, late last year. Neither companies have yet to reveal how much PayPal’s investment was, yet Cambridge’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate it was a sum that was less than $3.5 million USD. Accordingly, the investment wasn’t for a staggering amount, but it does definitively raise the prospect of PayPal making further — and perhaps bigger — overtures toward blockchain tech in the future. As for what comes next for the meld, it’s an open question for now. “We can’t talk specifically about anything commercially that we are doing because it’s all sort of exploratory now,” Cambridge Blockchain chief executive officer Matthew Commons noted on the news. Cambridge Blockchain’s software could be used in conjunction with all distributed ledgers, so it’s not just centered around any single project or platform. With that said, the startup has done plenty of work on specific chains, not least of which has come from their membership in the rather impressive ranks of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), which Cambridge joined last year. The EEA is a “member-led industry organization” who focuses on facilitating innovation around Ethereum in order to “empower ALL enterprises,” per the group’s website. Cambridge has been in good company there, as the body boasts hundreds of members including high-profile heavyweights like Microsoft, Intel, and JP Morgan. As such, PayPal now interestingly has an indirect stake in the EEA via its growing involvement in Cambridge. PayPal isn’t the only mainstream power looking at blockchain for identity-based use cases. Back in February, Facebook’s founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the social media company’s leadership had been exploring the idea of blockchain-based distributed logins. “You […] take your information, you store it on some decentralized system, and you have the choice of whether to log in in different places, and you’re not going through an intermediary,” Zuckerberg said at the time. What will come of these recent deliberations remains to be seen, but they come as Facebook increasingly has blockchain on the brain. In other recent PayPal news, crypto analytics firm DataLight determined in a new report that Bitcoin trounced the PayPal network when it came to total transaction volume last year.  DataLight found that the Bitcoin network facilitated nearly $3.5 trillion in transactions in 2018. That sum was considerably more than the $578 billion that PayPal facilitated in the same span. Crypto proponents will say that reality shows PayPal should realize the insurgent blockchain space is worthy of more than just respect.",

        "passage": "In Seoul, South Korea, global blockchain developer DGE has launched the beta services of its gold trading platform Digital Gold Exchange and its cryptocurrency exchange COINZEUS. Both have been open for business since December 31 of 2018. What a way to start the new year… During the first quarter of 2019, DGE is set to engage in a vast partnership with the Korea Gold Exchange, thereby giving more customers within the region access to precious metals and respective portfolio expansions. By introducing residents to the Digital Gold Exchange, the venture is building a tie between cryptocurrency and gold and offering customers the chance to trade either via blockchain technology.  The process works as such: users purchase both physical and digital gold using the platform’s official cryptocurrency called the Midas Touch Gold (TMTG). Users first purchase the cryptocurrency which they can then exchange for physical ounces stored offsite or the digital gold MDG, which can later be converted to physical gold. Real ounces can also be exchanged for MDG. CPO of DGE Ja E. explains: Thomas Eom, CTO of DGE also added to the commentary, stating: He also stated that the open beta service will serve as a “testing ground for the autonomy of blockchain and the stability of markets through central control, which are the two main values of DGEx.” COINZEUS, the cryptocurrency exchange, is slated to receive equal or more attention than the gold venture. Representatives of DGE say that COINZEUS is being built from the ground up by industry experts who know just about everything there is regarding exchange development for future practicability, expandability and governance. They’re confident COINZEUS has what it takes to compete with other nationally-recognized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, and even held an early registration event for customers too excited to contain themselves. The time to pre-register for a COINZEUS account was between December 26 and 30 of last year. CEO of DGE Nathan Ryu explains: This move is a major step for a company that up until early last year, had a relatively solid relationship with blockchain and virtual assets. South Korea – still a long-term blockchain and crypto hub – once accounted for nearly one quarter of the world’s total cryptocurrency transactions, and most coins – given their rising popularity – sold well above market prices on most South Korean crypto exchanges.  Read: From Coinstack to Aergo: South Korea’s Enterprise Blockchain Sector Is on the Rise Sadly, the nation’s officials had their run-in with trouble during the first half of 2018 when two of the country’s biggest trading platforms – Coinrail and Bithumb – experienced hacks that resulted in thefts of roughly $30 and $40 million respectively. In addition, the country placed a full ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in late 2017 following concerns that many companies holding ICOs were fraudulent, and potentially seeking to rob investors of their hard-earned cash.",

        "passage": "It’s no secret that Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrneis a big fan of cryptos and blockchain technology. Now Overstock’s venture capital arm, Medici Ventures, has picked up 20% of Israeli wine tracking company VinX. The model that VinX is seeking to globalize is based on the wine sales system used by the Bordeaux Futures Model. Instead of buying wine after it has entered the marketplace, the token system that VinX created lets buyers have a crack at a bottle of wine while it is still in the barrels. This wine futures system will help buyers to ensure that the wine they purchase is authentic, and could also help producers gain working capital from wine before it is ready to be bottled.  Future wine production would be registered as tokens on a blockchain, and then could be purchased by interested parties. Much like other kinds of futures, prices could rise or fall before the physical commodity is delivered, which could engender another layer of financial speculation in the wine market. Regardless of how the market develops, this platform does have some potential advantages for consumers. Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk that, “There are a lot of middlemen in the wine industry that can be eliminated with blockchain, there is a lot of problems with counterfeits. We also think this technology is democratizing the purchase of wine.” It is likely that the ability to buy and trade wine in a tokenized form will ultimately add to prices paid by consumers. At the moment it is nearly impossible to speculate digitally on wine that is still sitting in barrels across the planet. If VinX is successful in popularizing their wine tokens, seemingly anyone would be able to speculate in wine, widening the market to a previously unknown degree. Jacob Ner-David, the founder of VinX, said that by, “Bringing consumers in direct contact with producers early in the wine-making cycle,” everyone involved will benefit. He went on to say that, “We are riding the wave of direct-to-consumer, which Overstock has been a leader of for almost 20 years,” via a statement. The global wine market is valued at more than $300 billion USD annually. Of that market, it is thought that there is at least $3 billion USD worth of counterfeit wine sold every year. The press release that announced the investment by Medici also claimed that up to 20% of the wine that is sold globally carries incorrect labeling. Patrick M. Byrne expanded on the challenges that wine buyers face in a press release, “Like any economy, the wine industry has difficulty scaling its middlemen-heavy systems in parallel with the growing demands of an increasing global market. VinX’s steps in tokenizing wine futures while allowing wine enthusiasts to know without a doubt that the bottles they purchase are filled with authentic wines will position the entire industry as a model of a new global economy that replaces old boys’ networks with frictionless trust through technology.” Like other markets that are regulated, but still subject to graft, the wine industry may benefit from this new platform, especially on the high end. VeChain, a Chinese blockchain company, is working on a similar platform to VinX. They claimed that, “At least half of the Chateau Lafite-Rothschild consumed in China is fake,” which hurts trust in the marketplace. When a person is paying a hefty price for a unique product, they want to make sure they get what they pay for. Blockchain could be a big part of ensuring the quality of highly sought after, and often counterfeited items. ReportLinker recently predicted predicted that over the next five years, blockchain applications in the food and agriculture industry could be worth as much as $400 million USD. The recent tie-up between Walmart and IBM for a blockchain-based veggie platform would lend credence to this position, which may be representative of much bigger things for blockchain technology.",

        "passage": "Hoard, a multi-currency crypto wallet which will eventually offer integrated buying, selling, and point of sale features has just announced it’s impending beta release. The company plans to be a competitor to Coinbase, as well as offering the ability for shoppers to use the app to make purchases using crypto and have the seller receive crypto or fiat. Read on as we go over Hoard and it’s upcoming beta release. According to it’s white paper, Hoard is “a set of financial tools built to make cryptocurrency investing, trading, payments and storage simple, accessible, and consumable by everyone.”  The Hoard homepage, hoardinvest.com The goal of the project is to create an easy to use and highly flexible app that encourages those new to cryptocurrency to be able to quickly and easy get involved. The company suggests that the current batch of cryptocurrency apps are “complex” and “stifle consumer adoption”. The final Hoard app is designed to allow future customers to “Buy. Trade. Sell. Track. Spend. Store. All in one integrated wallet”. The company is led by CEO Jason Davis, who was a former UX designer for Wells Fargo and a former VP of product for LegalHub. In a recent blog post, the company announced that their app will soon be entering a beta release phase. The announcement comes after about a year of wait since the company first went live. According to the announcement, the beta will allow participants to access the platform, store supported crypto assets, and sign up for an impending token sale (accredited investors only). What is most interesting about Hoard is their promised feature of being able to trade or exchange any cryptocurrency for any other. More surprising than that, the white paper claims that users will eventually be able to trade any cryptocurrency (that the platform supports) directly into fiat currency. If this offering comes true, it could significantly change the way people interact with crypto to fiat exchanges.  For in-depth guides on many top exchanges, check out our series here The other major planned feature that will go live when the final product is released is support for point of sale systems. Apparently, shops that support the Hoard app will be able to accept any form of payment that the platform supports, and receive any type of payment (fiat or crypto) that the seller wants. For example, if Hoard supports Dash, a buyer could buy something with Dash, and the seller could choose to receive all of their payouts in another supported altcoin like Litecoin, or just get fiat directly. But how will this be possible? This is what the white paper says their “any-to-any cryptocurrency exchange enables traders to trade any cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. This disrupts the status quo of only trading limited pairs of BTC, ETH and USDT.” As the company wants to compete with Coinbase, they could be facing a number of legal hurdles before they are able to allow their users to freely transact in crypto and crypto-to-fiat pairs. The largest potential concern would be if the company were required to get the same sort of licenses that a bank would need. The official website does not specifically say where the company is based, but the white paper states their aims to be a “US based MSB business”, to get a “Bitlicense” in New York, and to “legally file in all 50 states”. Thankfully, the US government has made several suggestions that they will not intentionally stifle or hinder cryptocurrency innovation within its boarders. However, the laws are in many cases still extremely vague. One example to consider would be Utah-based Salt Lending. The company initially promised that anyone in the US would be able to get a cryptocurrency-backed cash loan. This quickly changed when the company announced that only those who resided in a very small list of states would be eligible for loans for the foreseeable future. It is possible, though, that Hoard may be able to use these kinds of events as a way of avoiding these issues before they become problems. It would be reasonable to expect, however, that the company will be unable to do a uniform nationwide rollout, and instead could launch state-by-state. The company plans to offer its own token, OAR, in an upcoming sale. Unfortunately, the company has specified that only accredited investors will be able to participate. The tokens themselves will be used to allow customers to “invest, hold and use any currency they deem fit, circumventing any physical or digital borders” while using Hoard. In layman’s terms, it would appear that OAR tokens will be used to somehow speed up off-chain transactions and trading, and give the platform the liquidity it needs to operate.  For the holder, the white paper claims that they will be “incentivized to “hoard” our currency so they may transact freely with any other currency.”",

        "passage": "Earlier this week the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) announced that they have created a new “FinTech” license that allows blockchain or crypto companies to accept deposits of public money in the amount of $100 million Swiss Francs (CHF). The new FinTech license will be available starting in 2019, and has to be applied for. FINMA notes that this move has, “relaxed requirements,” for fintech firms, though some barriers still separate fintech firms from normal banks.  Unlike a bank, the new FinTech license from FINMA prohibits fintech firms from investing the public money they receive or paying interest on it. Most banks or corporations wouldn’t have these kinds of restrictions placed on them. Regardless, this new set of regulations shows that some countries are working toward creating a crypto friendly banking environment. The new FinTech license from FINMA is probably a direct result of fintech innovation from places outside of the banking sector. While still distinct from a regular bank, the new code that governs how the FinTech licensees will be granted references the Swiss Banking Act. FinTech companies that want to accept public funds will have to provide the Swiss regulators with information about their business, and how they plan to store any assets that they are entrusted with. Risk management, KYC and Anti-Money Laundering statutes will all apply to any company that receives a FinTech license in Switzerland, despite the fact they aren’t being given the same abilities that a bank would have.  Read: Bitcoin and Money Laundering: Complete Guide to Worldwide Regulations Switzerland has taken on moderate ground in the global crypto regulation arena. This most recent regulatory upgrade joins a few others from Swiss regulators, all of which seem to favour the cautious adoption of a liberal stance towards blockchain and digital assets. Many other influential nations haven’t been as quick to act on crypto regulations, except in the cases when they have been prohibited. China is perhaps the most notable example of a country that was fast to act to ban cryptos, once they became popular internationally. Cryptos have fallen into a strange legal area in the USA. They are currently being treated as a commodity for tax purposes, which has left some crypto traders in a lurch. Now it looks like there is a member of the US House of Representative that is trying to lock-down firmer regulations for an important global industry. Representative Warren Davidson (R) publicly revealed a bill that would create solid regulations for cryptocurrencies and ICOs earlier this week. According to Cleveland.com, Rep. Davidson announced that he will work to introduce his bill to the US House, at the Blockchain Solutions conference. The new bill would create an, “asset class,” for cryptos, and, “would prevent them from being classified as securities, but would also allow the federal government to regulate initial coin offerings more effectively.” As it stands today, the legislation for cryptos varies from state-to-state, and even within federal US Government regulatory bodies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies cryptos as securities, even though the Commodities and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) classifies them as commodities. Clearly, new legislation is needed in the world’s largest capital market. As cryptos grow more popular globally, nations that don’t give new businesses a sense of legal stability aren’t going to be as attractive for new investments. Rep. Davidson told media that ICO regulation would require, “light touch,” regulation. This may prove a hard sell in the USA, where numerous ICOs turned out to be total frauds. The ICO feeding frenzy that emerged as crypto prices exploded last year has left many people wondering about the ethics of the entire crypto community, and given regulators all the evidence they need to come down hard on one of the most innovative ways to raise capital in human history. Ultimately, countries will have to face strong competition in the international arena when it comes to crypto regulations, and nations that choose to overlook an emerging industry may face severe consequences down the road. A lack of access to what could be the next global capital market could be catastrophic for countries that resist crypto-based development, no matter how powerful governments and central banks may seem at the moment.",

        "passage": "Top Trump administration members — including President Trump himself — have recently been taking increasingly open stances against cryptocurrencies. A related thread has unfurled this week as the White House coordinated with various agencies to publish two advisories that, in part, highlighted how cryptocurrencies are sometimes used to facilitate narco-trafficking.  Of course, crypto proponents argue that skeptics of the technology over-magnify its use in illicit activities. So if leaders in the Trump administration like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin — who will “not be loaded up on bitcoin” in 10 years — want to generally discourage good and bad actors alike from using the tech, it’s in their interest to highlight these activities where they can. The new advisories didn’t center on cryptocurrencies, but rather on the various methods that Chinese and Mexican drug suppliers use to get Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the hands of U.S. buyers. To that end, one of the bulletins was for financial institutions and the other for “digital private sector platforms” like e-commerce sites. Specifically then, these documents come as the White House wants to help companies “in detecting and reporting related activity” regarding to illicit purchases of drugs like Fentanyl, which can be up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. The backdrop is the ongoing opioid addiction crisis in the U.S. “The epidemic is tearing away at the social and economic fabric of our communities, while [transnational crime organizations], international drug traffickers, money launderers, and other criminal actors profit off the misery of victims,” one of the advisories read. Among other payment rails, the White House said virtual currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, and Monero are sometimes used by U.S. citizens to buy these drugs from foreign suppliers via “clearnet” or “dark web” sites. “On these websites, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids can be purchased with Bitcoin or more traditionally-accepted payment methods,” the coordinating agencies said. That virtual currencies have been used in such transactions has been no secret across many fields since before the takedown of the Silk Road marketplace back in 2013. The growing and continued critical spotlight suggests the Trump administration doesn’t plan on sitting on its hands where possible when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Money of any kind can be used for bad or good deeds, and the current administration is certainly being proactive when it comes to addressing bad deeds done with virtual currency — something we haven’t seen before out of a U.S. presidency. The latest domino to drop in that regard came on August 21st, when the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklisted the cryptocurrency addresses of three Chinese citizens that the watchdog says were involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said the crackdown comes as a campaign is just beginning to bring a spotlight to new kinds of crime flows: To be sure, cryptocurrencies are interesting and notable for much more beyond crime. The fact that the Trump admin has been zooming in on that aspect while not simultaneously fostering innovation around the tech is telling. Why? Because the administration could be tough on crime while also fostering crypto innovation. But we’ve only seen the toughness to date.",

        "passage": "If you’ve facilitated large-scale illicit activity online using cryptocurrencies, just waiting for a few years to make an escape is no longer going to cut it courtesy of increasingly advanced blockchain analysis techniques. That reality was on full display this week, as the U.S. Justice Department’s Southern District of New York (SDNY) announced the arrest of 60-year-old Ohio resident Hugh Brian Haney and the unsealing of federal charges against him in a cryptocurrency-centric case.  Haney is said to have laundered millions of dollars worth of bitcoin he accrued from drug deals on the infamous and now-defunct Silk Road dark web marketplace. Authorities seized $19 million USD worth of bitcoin from the Ohio native as part of his Thursday arrest. Notably, the Silk Road was shuttered by the FBI, America’s top law enforcement agency, back in 2013. The New York unit of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a wing of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, helped SDNY on the Haney case. HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Angel Melendez confirmed his team had “employed blockchain analytics” to track Haney’s bitcoin activities back to the Silk Road. What those analyses entailed remains unclear, though it’s possible the agents turned to one of the cryptoeconomy’s increasingly prominent blockchain investigator firms for outside expertise. For example, CipherTrace chief executive officer Dave Jevans was tapped as a Bitcoin expert witness earlier this year in a Canadian court case that dealt with dark web transactions. Whatever techniques or services were used, investigators determined Haney had been transferring bitcoin associated with the prolific Pharmville Silk Road vendor account (an account Drug Enforcement Administration officers had been making controlled buys from as early as 2011) to an undisclosed cryptocurrency exchange starting in 2017 — four years after the marketplace was taken down. When that cryptocurrency exchange asked Haney where his large sum of bitcoin had come from, he declared them as mining proceeds. It was when the man finally converted the BTC to $19 million on that platform that authorities executed a search warrant, freezing the cash at an unnamed bank in the SDNY’s jurisdiction. In his office’s announcement, SDNY attorney Geoffrey S. Berman hailed the result as a textbook example of what will happen if crooks try to capitalize on tainted coins: The fact that Haney non-nonchalantly transferred his bitcoin to a cryptocurrency exchange suggests he was unaware that his earnings had been tracked by U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) experts. It also suggests the man was unfamiliar with, or simply too lazy to resort to, coin mixing services, which of course are not strictly the domain of criminals but are sometimes resorted to obscure the source of illicit funds. Some cryptocurrency exchanges freeze funds that have interacted with mixing services, either simply because a mixer itself is flagged as suspicious or because the mixed funds a user has received has come from a tainted source. With that said, Haney still might have been run into off-ramping problems if he had mixed his coins or mixed only parts of his trove. However, the man took zero effort to cover his tracks in sending all his bitcoin to a cryptocurrency exchange straight from a large Pharmville address. Now he’s facing the music — and decades in jail — as the past has caught up with him.",

        "passage": "It is often said that the best things in life are free, however using your employer’s electricity supply to mine cryptocurrencies is never a good idea. According to Chinese publication HK01, a teacher at a School in Chenzhou, China, has been caught using the institutions electricity for their ethereum mining operations. The story begun when the culprit – school Principle, Lei Hua, purchased 10,000 Yuan worth of mining equipment. Upon recognizing the vast levels of energy that mining requires, Hua proceeded to shift his mining rig over to one of the school’s internal dormitories. Once the profits begun to roll in, Hua then spent a further 40,000 Yuan on additional rigs, with the view of increasing his earning potential. However, with the dormitory room unable to facilitate a mining rig of that magnitude, Hua decided to move his operations to the school’s main building.  Although the electricity theft was able to go unnoticed for a plethora of months, other staff members begun to notice that the internal computing systems were running somewhat slow. Moreover, the report also claims that staff members complained that their computers were generating a significant amount of noise – something that is often the case with cryptocurrency mining. As one would expect, once the individual was subsequently caught, the school swiftly relived Hua of his academic duties. Although it was believed that the school’s Vice Principle – Wang Zhipeng, was also involved in the operation, he was able to keep with position, albeit with an official warning. This isn’t the first time that allegations of electricity theft for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining has surfaced. In early 2017, it was reported that Nicholas Berthaume, an employee at the Federal Reserve, was alleged to have been using the organization’s servers to mine Bitcoin. The brazen individual is believed to have run his mining operation from within the Central Bank between 2012 and 2014. Although the employee was subsequently fined $5,000 and sentenced to a year of probation, two years’ worth of Bitcoin mining during a period where competition was minute would have potentially netted the individual a significant sum – at least in today’s money. Then in 2014, it was reported that a computer systems manager from within New York’s Department of Education was caught red-handed in his effort to mine Bitcoin. It was alleged that Vladimir Ilyayex – the miner in question, installed a mining software client that was set to run between 6pm and 6am. Ilyayex subsequently admitted that he monitored the mining program remotely from home. The individual not only lost his job, but also received a small fine of just over $600. More recently, Matthew McDermott, an information manager at Florida’s Department of Citrus, was arrested for official misconduct and grand theft. Not only did the employee discretely install mining software on the department’s computers, but he also used his state credit card to buy GPU units worth more than $22,000. An internal investigation begun when the department noticed their electricity bills had increased by more than 40 percent. And finally, ABC News reported in March 2018 that two IT employees from within Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology were using the organizations ultra-powerful computing systems to mine cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen what punishment the two unnamed individuals were accustomed to, however it was enough to warrant the attention of the Australian Federal Police. Ironically, the aforementioned Bureau were involved in an additional crypto-related scam just one month prior, as their website unwittingly displayed advertisements regarding a fraudulent Bitcoin investment scheme. Ultimately, this should act as a lesson to all of us. If you notice your electricity consumption is going through the roof, somebody might be using your computing systems to mine cryptocurrencies!",

        "passage": "Australia’s consumer protection watchdog says instances of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related fraud increased by nearly 200 percent in 2018. Despite the year-long bear market that characterized the period, it appears cryptocurrency con-artists continue to enjoy relative success defrauding unsuspecting victims. Meanwhile, even with the rising figures, cryptocurrency-related fraud continues to constitute an insignificant portion of financial crimes in Australia and several other countries around the world.  According to a recently published report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Bitcoin fraudsters earned about $4.3 million from various fraudulent cryptocurrency-related schemes in 2018. This figure represents a 190 percent increase from the total sum recorded in 2017. The consumer protection watchdog says it recorded about 674 incidents of suspected scams that mostly targeted men aged 25 to 34. Most of these fraudulent schemes used social media platforms and emails to attract potential victims. In the report titled “Targeting scams: Report of the ACCC on scams activity 2018,” the regulatory agency declared that investment fraud was the most popular scam. This type of scam accounted for about 42 percent of recorded losses ($1.8 million). An excerpt from the report reads: According to the report, other cryptocurrency-related scams involved the use of Bitcoin ATMs. There are currently 22 Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, with nine located in Sydney alone. The 190 percent increase in Bitcoin fraud in Australia occurred during a period when the cryptocurrency market as a whole experienced a massive value decline. The bear market of 2018 saw prices fall by more than 80 percent across the entire cryptocurrency market. However, the ACCC reports that the state of the market did little to discourage fraudsters from using Bitcoin as a means to scam their victims. The ACCC said scammers took advantage of the left-over hype from late 2017 to lure more victims into fraudulent investment schemes in 2018. In many of the reported cases, the con artists chose to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a way of circumventing security protocols used by banks. According to the ACCC report: As previously reported by Blockonomi, scam statistics showed Australians losing more than $14 million to scams in 2019 as at the end of March 2019. As at the time of writing this article, the figure has risen to $25 million. Even with the 190 percent increase, Bitcoin fraud still accounts for a minute portion of the total financial crimes’ scene in Australia. According to ACCC figures, the total recorded losses from the more than 170,000 reported scams stood at $75 million. Thus, cryptocurrency-related fraud only amounted to five percent of the total losses attributed to con artists in the country. The figures from Australia follow the trend seen in many different countries. Earlier in 2019, the National Police Agency of Japan released its money laundering report for 2018. Bitcoin-related money laundering only constituted about 1.7 percent of all recorded cases. Apart from financial crimes, security experts also remain unanimous in the declaration that criminal elements like drug cartels and jihadists aren’t adopting cryptocurrency with cash still the preferred conduit for their illegal activities.",

        "passage": "Many in the cryptocurrency ecosystem simply assume government agents are active therein. A new report making the rounds in the cryptoeconomy gives further credence to those assumptions in indicating a nefarious, state-sponsored force has entered the scene via a capable Chinese hacking team. The hackers, a group known as “Advanced Persistent Threat 41,” or APT41, have made a name for themselves in the cybersecurity world since 2012. In recent years, the team has specialized in hacking companies for financial gain, particularly video game companies that use in-game money.  Yet, according to the authors of the aforementioned report — cybersecurity firm FireEye — APT41 doesn’t appear to be interested in profits alone. Indeed, as the company explained in their analysis, the group’s operations appear closely aligned with the ruling Chinese government’s domestic and international strategies: FireEye also noted that APT41’s operations have recently been widening to new industries, with companies involved with cryptocurrencies being some of the group’s latest targets. (Note: in the spring, China’s top macroeconomic administrators said cryptocurrency mining should be terminated in the country, in the very least suggesting the nation’s authorities are increasingly attentive to the sector). For example, FireEye determined that email addresses and malicious code APT41 has used in the past have been reused from time to time by the group, and that one of those addresses were deployed in a phishing campaign against an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange last year. The group’s attacks have targeted companies and institutions in more than a dozen countries, ranging from the U.S. to South Korea, and if FireEye’s report is any indication, they are likely to conduct more cryptocurrency-centric attacks in the future. The cryptoeconomy is like any other space: it has its share of good and bad actors. North Korean cyber specialists are increasingly carving out their position leading that latter group. This week, Reuters reported on a United Nations analysis its journalists had reviewed, with that analysis indicating the rogue state of North Korea has raised as much as $2 billion USD to date through cyberattacks designed to raise money for the country’s arms programs. Notably, part of those cyberattacks have targeted cryptocurrency trading platforms, cryptocurrency mining operations, and mainstream banking institutions. The U.N. investigators who compiled the report discovered nearly 40 episodes of North Korean hackers targeting these types of venues across nearly 20 countries as part of the rogue state’s funding efforts. In particular, the investigators highlighted how North Korea’s targets against crypto enterprises made it easier for its agents to “generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.” Such a dynamic partially served as the basis for the newly passed FATF rules, which were ratified by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force this summer. Hackers may feel comfortable roving about in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but cybersecurity experts are also getting better understandings of these hackers as time goes on. For example, the massive Coincheck hack last year that netted attackers more than 500 million NEM (XEM) was initially speculated to be the work of North Korean agents. Yet reporting earlier this summer revealed that malware with Russian origins had been found on Coincheck employee computers. It wasn’t definitive proof that Russian hackers were involved, but the revelation showed that experts are closing in on understanding the wider attack style.",

Accordingly, the bitcoin price was up more than four percent on the day, up 10 percent on the week, up 66 percent over the last three months, and up 1,166 over the last five years. The OG crypto peaked at approximately $20,000 in December 2017 and then experienced a prolonged bear market in 2018, meaning BTC is still down 41 percent on the year as such.  Most of the other top cryptocurrencies also saw modest gains on the day, as well. Ether (ETH) was up more than two percent to $162.70, bitcoin cash (BCH) was up over seven percent to $290.15, and litecoin (LTC) was up nearly five percent to $77.29. With the upward trend, the bitcoin market capitalization reached over $100 billion once more, while the wider cryptoeconomy market cap hit $177 billion. In kind, the bitcoin dominance rate is presently hovering over 55 percent. The bitcoin price’s steady and sustained gains so far this year have lead to an acute surge of optimism and awareness in the space that has seemingly proven reflexive. In other words, the increasingly positive sentiments around bitcoin as of late have generated further buy pressure upon the genesis crypto. In recent days the cryptoverse has been rocked by allegations that Bitfinex, one of the space’s biggest exchange’s and backers of the tether (USDT) stablecoin, has lost control $850 million worth of “comingled” company and client funds. That charge came to light after the office of the New York Attorney General (NY AG) enjoined Bitfinex’s operators iFinex and tether issuers Tether Limited, ordering the two entities to preserve all pertinent documents and to stop using tether’s reserves to cover the $850 million loss. Bitfinex has since pushed back against the thrust of the NY AG’s arguments, having declared they’re working to retrieve the seized funds from state actors. In any case, if such a charge came forth last year during the worst of 2018’s bear market, then marked sell-offs across the cryptoeconomy would’ve been likely. The fact that the BTC price has just hit a high in 2019 suggests that the ecosystem’s bearish trends may have shifted into the next bullish market cycle. For its part, Bitfinex apparently thinks the ecosystem is ripe enough for a major fundraising effort. The exchange is reportedly releasing an exchange coin, a la Binance’s Binance Coin (BNB), in order to help cover last year’s $850 million loss.  An iFinex statement has since confirmed that tether tokens are only 74 percent backed by cash reserves at the moment. Concerns over tether’s solvency have been a sticking point in the crypto space for years, so the fact that such a revelation hasn’t led to crypto markets spinning into an immediate downturn is notable. Where the bitcoin price goes from here in the short term is anyone’s guess. But the top crypto’s recent momentum has started attracting mainstream interest again, whatever happens going forward. Regarding bitcoin’s adoption prospects, some major threads to consider revolve around how the enterprise-minded platforms of Bakkt, Fidelity Digital Assets, and ErisX will fare. Bakkt is still waiting for approval from the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch its physically-settled bitcoin futures. Fidelity Digital Assets has already started trialing its platform with select institutional customers, and ErisX launched its spot trading crypto derivatives platform this week. If these platforms become popular among large firms, then the cryptoeconomy can expect an associated boost.",

        "passage": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has barred banks from in any way dealing in or facilitating those dealing in cryptocurrencies with immediate effect. Citizens will no longer be able to buy digital currency using their banking facilities as the central bank has banned them from “dealing with or providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or selling virtual currencies”. The section of the statement dealing with “Virtual Currencies” read: In announcing fiscal policy during a bi-monthly release outlining plans for 2018 – 2019, the Reserve said that any entity that falls under their jurisprudence may not provide services to anyone – individual or company – that buys, sells or otherwise deals with digital coins. While India has previously made damning noises about digital coins, the country is also a blockchain fanatic, looking to lead the way in blockchain application and development. India was a “touch and go” case study in the effects of regulatory unfolding impacting national cryptocurrency enthusiasm, but has now fallen into a slump in comparison to the rest of the world. Global virtual currency sentiment has matured and is now broadly positive and growing.  Indian finance minister Arun Jaitle, Image by Forbes  The latest stance by the RBI pushes the country back, aligning it with authoritarian regimes like China. Tim Draper in an interview with Economic Times, said : (If) India is thinking of making (cryptocurrency) illegal… other countries will raise their hands to get all the (blockchain) entrepreneurs (from India). If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake. The policy shift means that fiat to cryptocurrency conversion in India through exchanges will soon cease to exist. Direct deposits or cross-border facilitation with family or associates acting as agents or using decentralized exchanges like Localbitcoins and Bisq will be the only routes for Indian citizens to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. This is essentially a step backward, taking India back to pre-exchange era. The financial services head of EY India, Abizer Diwanji, confirmed: “A person will not be able to transfer money from his savings account to his cryptowallet.” The RBI is on record as constantly warning the population of associated risks when buying, selling or otherwise trading or transacting with virtual currencies. While it didn’t dampen enthusiasm at the time, those warnings have now come home to roost, with the banker deciding that consumer protection outweighs any other civil liberty in the matter of digital coins. In a now-typical stance emerging from lawmakers all over the world – one that shows how little they understand of cryptocurrencies – the RBI announcement did acknowledge the value of the technical platform of blockchain. That said, cryptocurrencies, in spite of their underlying construct, have alarmed the central bank in its considerations of money laundering, financial market stability and other broad consumer concerns. RBI, in line with many nations’ central banks, feels a keen obligation to protect consumers in terms of its mandate. All central banks on record consistently point to the Wild West nature of some exchanges and ICOs and fear the unregulated arena’s ability to enable large-scale fraud and other criminal activity. Banks that currently offer services in the form of transactional or investment accounts that hold funds derived of cryptocurrency dealings will need to give those customers reasonable notice of termination of services, as allowed for in the announcement. The central banker will issue a further bulletin detailing the necessary steps for banks to extricate themselves from such relationships within a specified time period. The announcement by the RBI also included mention of a possible national cryptocurrency, in a further demonstration of regulators’ desire to keep the same ship afloat in turbulent times. It seems central banks actually don’t have a problem with virtual currencies, as long as they own them. In January 2018, India’s central bank noted cryptocurrency’s impact on the formal banking sector as an item for concern. The RBI warned India’s banks, instructing them to scrutinize more closely transactions made by individuals, companies and exchanges that were dealing in digital coins. In a previous press release, the RBI seemed to address end users more than the banks themselves, saying “… any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.” Usually Indian markets would trade cryptocurrencies at a premium of 10-15 % over international markets, however post this announcement markets immediately crashed by around 25%. Currently bitcoin is trading in India at 399,900 INR ( 6140 USD ) whereas it’s trading for 6642 USD in international markets at the time of writing this. The effects are not observed in International markets because India accounts for only around 2% of the global trade volume.",

        "passage": "The CEO of Autodesk has described some of the most significant issues being faced in the construction industry, and he reiterated his belief that blockchain technology holds the solution to many of these issues, The Australian Financial Review reports. The construction sector is one that has been riddled with cases of corruption in recent years. The increased embezzlement of funds, as well as a desire for people to work without necessarily having their activities- or transactions- tracked, have caused constant friction between players in the industry. However, for Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost, the application of blockchain technology and its implementation in the sector can curb these corrupt practices and usher in an era of accountability and transparency.  Autodesk is one of the largest producers of design software, and the company has been serving the construction, engineering and architectural industries or years. Speaking at the 2018 Autodesk University event in Las Vegas, Anagnost addressed the reason why Autodesk has yet to consider the integration of blockchain into its Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Collection. He said his company had considered it but they “don’t have a point of view” that is known to the public. The AEC Suite, which consists of some of Autodesk’s flagship products (including Revit and AutoCAD) has gone through various phases of development over the years, and it has been responsible for helping to improve data and project information dissemination between collaborators on projects via cloud services. The products under the AEC suite have seen increased adoption due to their practical nature and ease of application. For Anagnost, the next step will involve the use of blockchain technology to develop the culture of trust and transparency that the construction industry is in need of. “What is blockchain good at? It’s a distributed, trusted ledger that cannot be altered and allows traceability and accountability. A technology like that in an environment like construction where various people involved in the process don’t trust each other is going to find some kind of application.” The construction industry has also been rife with issues of embezzlement. “When people are paying hundreds of millions of dollars on large projects, something is always happening somewhere that isn’t quite right. There’s always someone bleeding off resources or money in some inappropriate way,” Anagnost explained. Based on some of his on-site experiences with construction workers, Anagnost said that there is much favoritism going on, and transparency is disrupted when familiarity is allowed to get in the way of work. With the use of blockchain technology, construction processes related to logging and quality control can be optimized. Anagnost believes that blockchain’s greatest value to the construction industry is its ability to deliver a greater degree of trust and traceability, especially in an ecosystem where trust is a scarce trait. Smart contracts have been particularly touted as an integral part of bringing some form of transparency to the management of construction projects. Suppliers can directly request their payment based on the services or goods provided, which will reduce the need for intermediaries (who have been known to cause delays and lapses in transaction handling). Anagnost also mentioned that his company is currently working on a form of non-blockchain digital escrow services, which can also help to improve the development of trust in the sector.",

        "passage": "When you sign up for an announcement, be it Google, Twitter, or even some crypto asset exchanges, the service providers often prompt you to input your personal phone number as a way to add an extra layer of security. Although this medium of account protection works for most, hackers have begun to find ways to exploit this measure. And interestingly, due to the state of the cryptocurrency market and how its infrastructure works, these bad actors have begun to specifically target Bitcoin/digital asset holders.  According to a recent report from technology and cybersecurity publication ZDNet, over ten members of the cryptocurrency and blockchain community has been hit by SIM (referring to the SIM card that handhelds use to connect to networks), swapping attempts over recent weeks. Firstly, for those unaware, SIM swapping (jacking) is a form of attack during which an actor uses social engineering tactics — namely ringing up AT&T and other telecom companies under a false identity and malicious premises — to switch the victim’s phone number to their own device. In doing this, the attacker can use the phone number of their victims to hijack accounts or access pertinent bits of information meant to be under lock and key. Most of the time, hackers stray away from anything to do with the regulated financial system, as suspicious transactions can be flagged and traced by authorities. But with digital assets, especially a privacy-enabling digital coin like Monero, and their respective exchanges, hackers can withdraw cryptocurrencies from a hacked account at much less risk than withdrawing hacked PayPal funds to a States-based bank account, for instance. In a matter of a few hours, an attacker can take over one’s phone number, access a victim’s email account, forcefully break into cryptocurrency exchange accounts, withdraw Bitcoin or what have you into their own addresses, and then blend the coins for privacy. The large attack surface provided by how telecom operators, email accounts, and digital asset exchanges work today has resulted in there being a massive SIM swapping target on the back of cryptocurrency’s biggest names. Alternatively, this attack method can be used to break into social accounts, like one’s Twitter or Telegram, which are where deals happen, key tidbits of information are exchanged, and personal conversations take place. Attackers have surely taken note. Three weeks back, Sean Coonce, part of BitGo’s engineering team, was SIM swapped. In the attack, he lost over $100,000 worth of crypto assets and fiat holdings from his personal Coinbase account. And in the days that followed, other workers and influencers in the crypto industry made similar reports. Although most didn’t report the loss of their holdings, Ethereum proponent Chris Robison, ConsenSys alumnus Ameen Soleimani, MolochDAO team member Cassandra Shi, and many others reported that they temporarily lost access to their texts and calls for no apparent reason.  While the frequency of these attacks, for the time being, has slowed, it is important to note that all users attacked in this recent spree were based in the United States and were clients of T-Mobile and the Bitcoin-friendly AT&T (funny, huh). It is unclear whether this SIM jacking trend has coincided with the return in the Bitcoin price, which is up by almost 100% in the past two months. Despite these recent attacks, SIM swappers often don’t get away with their crimes, or at least not for long. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) managed to arrest and charge nine individuals — a SIM jacker group that called themselves “The Community” — for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Surprise, surprise, the nine was participating in SIM swapping, which allowed them to steal over $2.4 million worth of cryptocurrency over a purported seven attacks. Lone attackers, including a man who stole $5 million worth of cryptocurrency, have also been caught.",

        "passage": "Many of you are probably familiar with Telegram, a chat app that allow you to access all kinds of different channels and garner information pertaining to some of your favorite subjects. You can talk to anyone in the world using Telegram, but the app offers more than just chat options – it boasts its own crypto. Unfortunately, not everyone’s happy about this. The nation of Iran, which has had a rather mixed to negative relationship with cryptocurrencies, is now banning access to Telegram in its attempts to crackdown on the usage of digital assets, which regulators say bring criminal activity to Iran. Secretary of the Criminal Content Definition Task Force Javad Javidnia says that anyone caught using Telegram in Iran or utilizing Gram – the app’s cryptocurrency – will be subject to national security laws and will be given the appropriate punishment.  In addition, regulators will also see the action as a means of disrupting the national economy. Kind of a harsh move on their part, but in any case, users can expect to see officials bringing the hammer down if they step out of place. Javidnia explains: Iran isn’t the only region to look down on Telegram and consider it a national threat. In Russia, Telegram has also been banned when in 2018, the chat application held its own initial coin offering (ICO). Russian officials explained they were worried about the fundraising plan due to potential fraud and lagging investor safety.  Read: The Telegram ICO Has Raised a Massive $1.7 Billion So Far Iran believes Telegram’s entry into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space could “undermine the national currency of Iran.” The country is under strict sanctions set forth by President Donald Trump and the United States and has experienced inflation and economic damage as a result. To be fair, however, Iran has always held a particularly negative attitude towards cryptocurrency, having gone so far as to restrict access to cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018 thanks, in part, to bitcoin’s increased popularity among the country’s residents. At the same time, however, the country has been discussing the notion of building its own cryptocurrency for years as a way of avoiding sanctions in the future, though it appears officials don’t want any competition getting in the way. The country’s central bank is reportedly working with other institutions to control the influx of digital currencies in Iran like bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to discourage their use and get residents to see the national virtual currency as their only payment option. Last February, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi – minister of Iran’s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology – released the following message on Twitter: In 2017, the country temporarily restricted access to both Telegram and the social media giant Instagram after a nationwide protest. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also enforced a full ban on Telegram use by government officials following the protest’s breakup. Iran isn’t the only rogue nation to try and pull its own cryptocurrency out of a hat. 2018 was saturated with stories regarding Venezuela and the petro, a digital asset that President Nicolas Maduro alleged was backed by the country’s many oil reserves. The currency has spawned controversy throughout the industry and petro-trading has been officially banned in the U.S.",

        "passage": "Nasser Hakimi, a senior official of Iran’s central bank says bitcoin trading is illegal in the country. Hakimi also issued warnings about the risks inherent in cryptocurrency trading given the incessant price fluctuations in the market. Iranian authorities have also recently cracked down on mining activities accusing miners of putting too great a burden nation’s electricity grid. There are reports that Iran plans to adopt blockchain technology to upgrade its banking and finance sector to meet up with modern standards.  Speaking to Tasnim, an Iranian media establishment, Hakimi, the deputy governor for new technologies at the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) declared that bitcoin trading is illegal in the country. According to Hakimi, Iran’s Supreme Council on Countering Money Laundering prohibited any forms of cryptocurrency trading. The senior central bank officials, however, noted that the prohibitions only applied to the buying and selling of cryptocurrency and not to the mining process. Given the re-emergence of tensions with the United States and the renewal of economic sanctions, some analysts predicted that Tehran might look to cryptos as a way of circumventing the financial blockade. The global banking communication network SWIFT has also delisted Iranian commercial banks. The country’s fiat currency has also suffered devaluation forcing many to acquire cryptos with their bitcoin wallets becoming their de facto banks. As previously reported by Blockonomi, the CBI released a draft document containing preliminary regulations for the local crypto industry. Hakimi’s statement seems more likely to force BTC trading underground in Iran rather than stop the market entirely given the trends set in other places like China and India. For Hakimi, crypto trading remains a risky proposition, one that citizens should avoid. The senior CBI official also advised investors to be wary of crypto Ponzi schemes. Despite the distinction drawn by Hakimi, the government has in recent times began a crackdown on bitcoin miners in the country. Iran has become a significant BTC mining arena as companies look to take advantage of cheap fossil-based energy. This influx of miners has seen an increase in electricity usage which reportedly alarmed the government. Some mining farms are set up inside Mosques across the country due to the free supply of electricity. With bitcoin gaining more than 220% since the start of the year, mining activity appears to be at an all-time high. The network hash rate — the computing power security the blockchain and the difficulty have reached record levels. Last week, reports emerged of raids carried out on such establishments with over 1,000 mining rigs seized by authorities. Energy consumption ascribed to BTC mining remains a thorny issue for some government around the world. Earlier in the year, CoinShares released the latest update to its bi-annual report showing that renewable energy powered more than 74% of global BTC mining. Iranian authorities might be anti-bitcoin but the country has no problems with blockchain technology. The CBI is currently working with Areatak — a Tehran-based startup to develop a distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based banking framework. Stakeholders say the project called Borna aims to improve the country’s banking and financial sectors. Borna is being built using Hyperledger Fabric — one of the DLT solutions created by the Linux Foundation. When completed, Borna will also host private sector participants as a sort of operational sandbox for fintech solutions. The DLT framework will also serve as a unitary banking infrastructure for Iran which could become the basis for setting up cross-border transactions with other countries outside of the mainstream payment corridors.",

        "passage": "A second 2020 U.S. presidential contender has thrown their hat into the cryptoeconomy’s ring … or is rather hoping, at least to start, that stakeholders in America’s nook of the cryptoverse throw their hats into his. That’s because that candidate, California Representative Eric Swalwell Jr., has started accepting cryptocurrency donations for his 2020 campaign and has signaled support for boosting blockchain innovation in the U.S.   The crypto pivot was announced on May 23rd in conjunction with blockchain startup The White Company. The firm will serve to process all cryptocurrency donations made to the congressman’s campaign, which now accepts bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), ether (ETH), Stellar’s lumens (XLM), and the The White Company’s WSD token. Rep. Swalwell, whose congressional district – his state’s 15th – covers portions of California’s Alameda and Contra Costa counties, declared his candidacy for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination last month. He’s entered a stacked contest of more than two dozen prominent Democrats who are also are vying to face off against President Donald Trump in the country’s general election next year. The young congressman, who’s currently polling near the bottom of that crowded field of challengers nationally, is undoubtedly looking to round up support anywhere he can. Indeed, candidates like Rep. Swalwell must achieve one percent support in at least three preapproved polls or rake in donations from 65,000 different citizens to qualify for the Democratic Party’s high-profile televised debates next month. To boost his chances of making the cut, Swalwell’s figuratively extended a hand to America’s cryptocurrency users with the hope they’ll do the same in return. On its cryptocurrency donations landing page, the Swallwell campaign cast the congressman’s support for digital currencies and blockchain in a populist light, saying the technologies can be used to “empower” people: Notably, Rep. Swalwell’s acceptance of cryptocurrency donations comes on the heels of his fellow 2020 Democratic competitor Andrew Yang recently making a splash in U.S. crypto circles by outlining a pro-blockchain and pro-crypto platform. Yang, an entrepreneur by trade whose maverick policy ideas on subjects like universal basic income have led to a meme movement in #YangGang, released his campaign’s positions on the cryptocurrency space last month. As such, Yang has called for a reversal of the “chilling effect on the US digital asset market” that ambiguous and competing federal policies have created in the country to date, the candidate’s campaign website reads: As the first 2020 contender to formally come out with such a favorable and forthright stance on cryptocurrencies, Yang has won over some respect in the cryptoeconomy. Neeraj Agrawal, communications director for crypto advocacy group Coin Center, noted at the time that Yang “seems have come to the right conclusions on how to best address” the issues facing America’s cryptocurrency stakeholders. Yang has polled as high as three percent nationally in recent weeks, meaning he’s poised to participate in the upcoming presidential debates. Accordingly, Rep. Swalwell is similarly looking to win some respect from crypto users to help him get that much closer to joining Yang on the debate stage, upon which millions will be watching. Of course, both Yang and Rep. Swalwell are darkhorses going forward. But, if nothing else, they’re helping to push conversations around cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream of America.",

        "passage": "The Zambian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned the general public to desist from investing in an initial coin offering (ICO) promoted by a suspicious company. According to a report by The Lusaka Times, the company was not registered with the country’s regulatory body and was therefore not authorized to give investment advice.  Cases of fraudulent ICO projects are not uncommon, and various regulators and government agencies have taken time to warn investors against investing in investment schemes that especially promise exorbitant returns on investment. In a statement by the Chief Executive Officer of the Zambia SEC, Philip Chitalu, a company known as Kwakoo, was soliciting investment funds from Zambians for its ICO, Onyxcoin. Chitalu also added that the company’s activities, which include promotion and soliciting of funds for a product like Onyxcoin, fell under the purview of the Securities Act law. The country’s Securities Act, No. 41 of 2016, states that any person or persons offering investment advice for assets viewed as securities, or engaging in trading of such assets in Zambia, must seek approval from the SEC, except in cases where the law exempts such person/company. With the above definition, Kwakoo and its promoters’ actions were in contravention of Zambia’s securities law. Apart from failing to register with the SEC, Kwakoo lured investors with hyperbolic predictions for its Onyxcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency’s value would skyrocket to 1000% by June 2021. However, the Zambia CEO warned investors to be wary about the company and its representatives, stating that Kwakoo isn’t licensed or registered with the regulatory body to offer investment advice or seek funds from Zambians to invest in any financial product within or without the country. Furthermore, Chitalu alerted the public to the risks that came with ICOs, stating that the fundraising venture was not standard in Zambia. Also, the SEC would grant regulatory status depending on the ICO. Currently, there is no robust regulatory landscape in Zambia. The SEC released a notice concerning bitcoin, other virtual currencies, and ICOs. The notice recognized the growth of the cryptocurrency market, and how people are becoming more receptive towards bitcoin, altcoins, and ICOs. However, the SEC warned citizens that bitcoin and other virtual currency were unregulated in the country. Furthermore, the SEC states: Also, in terms of determining if any crypto asset is can be classified as “securities”, the SEC noted that ICOs likely had characteristics of financial securities. In October 2018, the Bank of Zambia, the country’s apex bank, stated that bitcoin and other digital currencies were not a legal tender in the country. Furthermore, investors trading in cryptocurrencies were doing so at their own risk. The country’s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEG) arrested three fraudsters who were involved in money laundering worth over $2 million. Per the report, the scammers lied to the investors that they would help them invest their funds in cryptocurrency. Apart for the Zambia SEC warning against falling into the trap of fraudulent ICO and crypto schemes, its U.S counterpart has issued similar warnings. According to a Blockonomi report back in April 2019, two American financial regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) advised investors to beware of fake bitcoin investment websites. The investors noted that these websites offered unsuspecting investors high returns on little investments and proceeded to give a list of warning signs to protect investors against fraudulent bitcoin investment schemes. Famous celebrities, heavyweight boxer Floyd Mayweather, and DJ and songwriter, DJ Khaled, who promoted the Centra ICO, were fined by the US SEC.",

        "passage": "It has become abundantly apparent that the Bitcoin price crash-induced crypto winter hasn’t managed to seduce bears. The crash in the broader cryptocurrency market, which sent investors running en-masse, has resulted in a number of layoffs at this (not so) budding sector’s most preeminent firms. Bitmain, Huobi, and even ShapeShift are among the notable startups that have purged employees to bolster their bottom line. But the bloodshed is far from over. An Israeli blockchain company is the most recent domino to have fallen in the Rube Goldberg machine-esque cryptocurrency space.  Per a report from local outlet Globes, First Digital Assets Group (FDA), a blockchain application group, will be dropping most employees from its payroll. Citing sources familiar with FDA’s operations, Globes wrote that the company will be “rethinking its policy,” leading to a company-wide overhaul. As a part of this refresh, FDA will purportedly be totally purging its industry research division, One Alpha. The Israeli upstart will also be putting its K1, Stamina, Titan, and Knox ventures on the backburner, merging a majority of these subsidiaries’ facets with the parent group. The insiders didn’t divulge the specifics, nor did First Digital Assets spokespeople, who corroborated the sources’ material. However, it is known that the conglomerate, launched in 2017 as the crypto market rallied dramatically, once had 65 employees in its Givatayim offices. FDA’s representatives told Globes that as Bitcoin underwent an “earthquake,” the C-suite at the company decided to focus on its “liquidity activity (cash flow),” while it aims to redirect its efforts at bolstering offerings built on blockchain platforms, “the technology of the future.” Funnily enough, the company added that it still has a “large sum” in its war chest, which has received $21 million from a handful of venture investors over the company’s two-year history. FDA’s decision to undergo a drastic restructuring comes after mining giant Bitmain shuttered its division in Israel. As reported by Blockonomi previously, the Beijing-headquartered company closed its blockchain development center, whose primary objective was to manage mining pool Connect BTC. The branch was also working on Bitmain’s foray into artificial intelligence, Sophon. Just weeks later, the company closed its Amsterdam offices and Bitcoin mining farm in Rockdale, Texas. Layoffs are harrowing, especially in a space as nascent as blockchain technologies, but one analyst claims that such shortcomings are necessary. How about that? Anti-establishment figure Travis Kling took to Twitter in late-January, remarking that the crypto ecosystem will take another bone-breaking, heart-stopping, and blood-inducing blow before a rally. In a foreboding tweet, Kling, the incumbent chief investment officer at Ikigai, noted that if Bitcoin is to see a resurgence, the recent array of industry shortcomings, including layoffs, exchange collapses, stringent regulation, and cries that “crypto is dead,” will be just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This comment is, of course, in reference to the popular sentiment that true capitulation marks a long-term bottom in any market cycle. The former portfolio manager at Steven Cohen’s personal hedge fund, Point72, isn’t the only industry insider to claim that depressed market conditions are needed. Bully Esq, a prominent analyst, noted that the “bursting” of the Dotcom Bubble was a “necessary correction,” as the downturn spawned Amazon, Google, and a number of other Internet mainstays. Drawing lines between the nascent Dotcom space and cryptocurrencies, Bully added that while a correction is hammering this space, now’s an optimal time for industry participants to accumulate, build, learn, network, and be ready for when this market begins to gain mainstream traction for the second time.",

        "passage": "Another cryptocurrency theft is in the books. Three individuals have been arrested in Bulgaria on suspicion of stealing cryptocurrency funds worth more than $5 million USD. The crypto arena has always been wrought with theft, and virtual assets seem to attract some of the most malicious players in the industry. Two of the biggest thefts in recent years that likely come to mind include Mt. Gox in February 2014 and Coincheck last January, both of which occurred in Japan.  Mt. Gox – widely considered the largest bitcoin exchange at the time – was the victim of a hack that saw over $400 million in BTC funds disappear practically overnight. To this day, many questions regarding the hack have gone unanswered, and Mark Karpeles, CEO of the exchange, ultimately spent over a year in a Japanese jail for his alleged role in the scandal. For nearly four years, Mt. Gox held the record for the largest cryptocurrency hack in history until Coincheck in January of 2018. Over $500 million in assorted crypto funds disappeared, prompting Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to become involved in the regulation and monitorization of the country’s crypto exchanges. The FSA later began sending warning letters to all Japan-based trading platforms and told them that if they didn’t up their security protocols to prevent further hacks, they would be shut down permanently. Though this latest robbery isn’t quite on the same level as Mt. Gox or Coincheck, it’s an ugly reminder that the cryptocurrency scene remains vulnerable and open to attacks, and that safety measures still aren’t where they should be. A statement regarding the robbery was released by the Bulgarian Prosecutor’s Office on Monday, November 26, 2018 explaining that local police had taken three men into custody on suspicion of cryptocurrency theft. At press time, it is alleged that the amount stolen by the individuals exceeds $5 million. However, approximately $3 million of that money has already been recovered. In addition, authorities say they’ve seized a $34,000 car owned by one of the individuals. It is believed the vehicle was purchased using the stolen crypto funds. The arrests come after the Prosecutor’s Office launched an investigation into the matter five months ago in June. Representatives say this is the first case of its kind in both Bulgaria or Europe. Prosecutors state that the alleged thieves were highly skilled in coding and related computer science, which allowed them to garner the crypto funds for so long without being noticed. Police have since raided the three men’s primary location and seized several pieces of equipment including hard drives, desktop computers and a set of notebooks containing a legion of both fake and legitimate accounts that police say the men were using to store the cryptocurrency. Thus far, only one of the men has posted bail (approximately $29,000). Cybersecurity firm CypherTrace recently released a report suggesting that nearly $1 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen since the beginning of the year – up by nearly 250 percent since 2017. Furthermore, it says that roughly 97 percent of bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading occurs via non-regulated exchanges, making investors and traders even more susceptible to thieves. Recent examples of similar thefts covered by Blockonomi include a SIM-swapping case where a northern California resident’s phone number was used to steal money from his Coinbase and Gemini accounts. It is estimated that the thief stole as much as $1 million, and only $300,000 has been recovered at press time. In addition, a Brooklyn-based man is now facing up to five years in prison for allegedly selling phony initial coin offerings (ICOs) to unsuspecting customers.",

        "passage": "Litecoin creator Charlie Lee has been known for his occasional controversial statement on Twitter. Today was no different as Lee has raised the ire of the Stellar community with a backhanded compliment. Reactions on Twitter were mixed, but generally the community did not appear to be in support of Lee’s assertion that Stellar Lumens does not deserve its market cap since it is not a mined currency.  So what did Lee say, exactly? Here is Lee’s original Tweet from earlier that has already collected over 500 comments:  Basically speaking, he congratulated Stellar, but suggested that due to the fact that Stellar Lumens are not mined through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, that they are somehow less deserving of their valuation and consequent market cap. Further, in response to a number of comments left to the Tweet, Lee suggested that only cryptocurrencies that are distributed through a mining reward of some type are truly decentralized. This is the same methodology employed by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. In the original bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto states that utilizing a block reward to distribute the currency will help to ensure a wider distribution – as opposed to a centralized model such as a central bank. Stellar Lumens, on the other hand, are not mined and were instead issued by the Stellar Foundation. In order to distribute the tokens, Steller performed what is essentially an airdrop and gave away a large portion of the available Lumens for free. Today, Lumens are distributed through a process the group calls inflation which again releases them without a monetary or computational cost. Lee saw quite a backlash for his comment and suggested that Stellar Lumens and other non-mined cryptocurrencies like XRP do not deserve their market cap. Here are a few examples of the shade thrown at Lee in response to his “complement”.    For the last 18 months, LTC has seemed to be a highly solid asset with a clear trajectory and use case. That being, since bitcoin fees were too high, Litecoin was the cryptocurrency of choice for spending. Now, Litecoin has seen a number of new and highly nimble competitors come onto the scene like Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ethereum Classic, and many other popular choices that offer even lower transaction fees than Litecoin. What’s worse is that Litecoin mining has arguably become highly centralized due to the Chinese company Bitmain being the only serious supplier of Scrypt-compatible miners, and that Bitmain operates its own Litecoin industrial scale mining operation.  Litecoin creator poses for photo with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu Even Charlie Lee himself has been accused of centralizing Litecoin when he infamously sold all of his LTC holdings when the asset was at its all-time high of well over $300 each. But it’s not all doom and gloom for the once number three asset. Litecoin has recently partnered with TokenPay in the purchase of a large piece of a German bank, as well as a handful of other groundbreaking partnerships that could prove to help keep Litecoin relevant and evolving. Litecoin prices recently have been steady between the $70-$90 range, so from a monetary perspective, Litecoin seems secure for the time being. But the Litecoin Foundation will undoubtedly need to keep working hard in order to make sure this asset doesn’t become irrelevant in the face of some steep competition. Images via @SatoshiLite",

        "passage": "For some reason or another, crypto assets and blockchain technologies have struck a chord with gamers — video gamers. Thus, it should come as no surprise that startups are trying to merge the two worlds, doing their best to blend gaming and this budding technology. The movement to “tokenize” and “blockchainify” this form of entertainment moved one step closer. Revealed Wednesday, Blockchain-centric studio Horizon Games has secured $3.75 million in funding from a series of cryptocurrency investors, including the venture fund spearheaded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.  Joining Ohanian’s Initialized Capital in the startup’s seed investment round was Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Inovia Capital, and more. It is important to note that the round closed last year, but was just announced now. If you were born in the western world within the last three or four decades, you likely played the “Pokemon” card game as a grade-school kid. Oddly enough, card games have stuck around. Horizon Games is looking to capitalize on this trend with its “Skyweaver” project, which has been dubbed by the company as a “Trading Card Game from Another Dimension.” Speaking to CoinDesk, Horizon’s chief executive, Peter Kieltyka, noted that with these funds and his team, he intends to build out a blockchain product that “his friends could use” and can potentially compete with digital card games such as “Hearthstone”, which has garnered dozens of millions of users across the globe. Like “Hearthstone”, “Skyweaver” is a game in which gamers can collect cards, create decks, and battle other players with said decks for rewards and digital game. The apparent and relevant difference is that this Ethereum-based project uses blockchain assets as its card management system, rather than centralized databases. More specifically, game’s collectible cards are run via contracts based on the newfangled ERC-1155, which is a token standard built by Enjin for mostly gaming purposes. As it stands, the Ethereum card game is currently in early access phase, but Horizon intends to open the game to the public by year-end. Horizon is the latest of pro-crypto investment made by Initialized Capital. It joins Coinbase, CoinTracker (a Bitcoin tax startup), DDEX (a decentralized exchange), Coinbundle (a cryptocurrency investment startup), and the well-known PolyChain Capital as Ohanian & Co’s crypto plays.  The news regarding this crypto gaming funding round comes as Ubisoft, a video game developer behind Rainbow Six, Far Cry, Just Dance, and other classics, has been revealed to have a “dedicated team” for blockchain applications in gaming. Citing sources familiar with the matter, French paper Les Echos stated that the Ubisoft-backed consortium is on the verge of launching its first blockchain use case. The purported idea is to make items, like digital cosmetics or weapons, accessible through a blockchain system. No specific game titles were mentioned, but it’s presumed that the Ubisoft team intends to facilitate cross-game item transfers. Ubisoft purportedly has plans to use the Ethereum blockchain for this program. Over in America, Epic Games, the company that is behind Fortnite, has partnered with a blockchain game distribution firm called The Abyss. The partnership between the Fortnite behemoth and the upstart competitor to Steam, a gaming community and video game distribution platform, will allow for Abyss users to access the Unreal Developers Networks. All these efforts are important because as Brian Mehler of EOS VC explained to me in a recent interview:",

        "passage": "The Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom’s top financial regulator, is moving against cryptocurrency derivatives products being accessible to everyday consumers. The watchdog, which works independently of the U.K. government, announced on July 3rd it was proposing to ban the “sale, marketing and distribution” of cryptocurrency-based exchange-trade products (ETPs) and derivatives — for example, futures offerings — to “all retail consumers.” The FCA has followed up the proposal — whose underlying work began last fall — by opening a consultation period in which a wide variety of industry participants can provide their positions on the would-be ban.  The authority cited companies that create or market crypto derivatives, exchanges, and retails investors as among the types of stakeholders suited for submitting feedback. In their Wednesday announcement, the FCA said the ban proposal was driven by a concern that retail investors weren’t savvy enough to “reliably assess the value and risks” of cryptocurrency derivatives. The authority said concerns over consumer incompetence stemmed from their perception that cryptocurrencies bear “no reliable basis for valuation”; are vulnerable to market manipulation; have a propensity for extreme volatility; and fail to demonstrate a “a clear investment need for investment products referencing them.” In other words, the FCA thinks average investors shouldn’t have anything to do with crypto derivatives. The watchdog estimated that a ban on such products could save as much as £75m annually by preventing domestic consumers from losing funds. The authority will process the feedback and make a final decision after the consultation period closes on July 10th. If the ban is green-lighted, the FCA will develop an official policy and formally publish it in the first quarter of next year. It seems the restrictions are more likely than not for now, if the watchdog’s already developing arguments are any indication. “There is growing evidence that cryptoassets are causing harm to consumers and markets,” the FCA said in its ban proposal. In January, the FCA released a consultation advisory in which it put forth tentative standards for what types of tokens were within its jurisdiction. In that advisory, the authority outlined what it saw as the three main types of cryptocurrency tokens: exchange tokens, utility tokens, and security tokens. Exchange tokens were said to be ones like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), whereas utility tokens were crypto assets that performed specific utilities on their respective networks. The FCA went on to argue that only security tokens fell within its jurisdiction, and that tokens could only be securities if they literally functioned like a debt instrument or a company share. At the time, legal experts in the cryptoeconomy applauded the nuance and implications of the authority’s classifications. The FCA’s new ban proposal on crypto derivatives shows the watchdog is also perfectly willing to disallow what it views as dangerous crypto investments where it can. In a first-ever milestone, the U.K. financial regulator approved an operational license for a cryptocurrency asset management firm. That firm, Prime Factor Capital, is headquartered out of London and manages cryptocurrency investments previously capped at the €100 million euro mark. With that FCA license now in tow, the hedge fund can expand its assets under management (AUM) higher than that threshold. The license officially slots the firm as an alternative investment fund manager within the European Union — a dynamic that means the fund can now also expand its reach further into Europe. With the company having paved the way toward FCA licensing, other similarly crypto-minded funds will certainly follow in its wake to achieve the regulator’s blessings.",

        "passage": "The public may now be closer to identifying the culprits behind the Coincheck hack, the largest the cryptoeconomy has experienced to date. Coincheck, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange based in Tokyo, saw its NEM (XEM) hot wallet scraped by hackers last January. The attackers netted 520 million coins, which were then worth approximately $530 million USD. As such, the economic impact was larger than the fallout caused by the 2014 Mt. Gox hack, which cost that exchange’s traders upwards of $400 million.  In the wake of the XEM heist, Coincheck committed to compensating affected traders to the tune of $0.81 per every XEM lost with the exchange’s own revenues. After the hack, speculation mounted that North Korean hackers were the culprits. Cybersecurity firms have found the country’s notorious hacker , Lazarus APT, did indeed steal billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2018. And Japan’s National Intelligence Service did initiate a probe last year as to whether Lazarus hackers led the Coincheck hack. Yet a new report suggests Russian hackers, not North Korean hackers, may have been involved in the episode. That report, published Monday by esteemed Osaka-based outlet Asahi Shimbun, revealed that computer viruses with definitive Russian origins had been discovered on the company computers of Coincheck employees. Those viruses were Netwire and Mokes. Netwire is a trojan style malware, designed to discreetly penetrate users’ devices for the purposes of keylogging, collecting information, establishing remote access, and more. Similarly, Mokes is malware that’s been specialized to steal valuable information like passwords via backdoor techniques. Cybersecurity experts consider both viruses to have been created in Russia. Notably, they are the types of malware that could have been used to compromise Coincheck’s internal system ahead of the exchange’s XEM hot wallet hack. Of course, the presence of Netwire and Mokes on Coincheck computers doesn’t mean a direct forensic trail has yet been established to the hackers. Rather, the development has revealed new circumstantial evidence, i.e. that tools originating from Russia and that Russian or Eastern European hackers would’ve presumably been comfortable using have turned up at the scene of the crime. It’s not beyond hackers to use tools that would superficially incriminate others, and it’s worth noting that Netwire and Mokes may have been used precisely for that reason: to throw off investigators from discovering the true perpetrators. So it’s still theoretically possible that North Koreans were behind the Coincheck hack. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has previously identified a wing within the increasingly advanced Lazarus Group they dubbed Bluenoroff. Kaspersky’s experts have said Bluenoroff specializes in financial attacks, meaning the team would have the technical skills to 1) lead a devastating attack on Coincheck and 2) obfuscate their attack’s origins. Yet the appareance of Netwire and Mokes in Coincheck’s infrastructure has others thinking otherwise. One cybersecurity expert who spoke to Asahi Shimbun said the viruses did indicate that Russian speakers could have been invovled. Whatever investigators end up determining was the case, it appears the Coincheck hackers had more than just a passing knowledge of cryptocurrency tech. That’s because the hackers seemed to have been aware that the NEM blockchain used the Proof of Importance (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI incentivizes node runners to hold large amounts of XEM, and it seems the hackers realized Coincheck’s XEM hot wallet was a low hanging fruit, as XEM was the only cryptocurrency the exchange wasn’t storing safely in cold storage accordingly. On a related and curious note, the Coincheck hack may have been the largest to date in the cryptoeconomy’s fledgling history, but the attackers didn’t make off with any money. The NEM Foundation somewhat controversially blacklisted the wallet the stolen XEM were sent to, which effectively condemned the coins to oblivion.",

        "passage": "Well-built privacy coins are tough, if not impossible, to crack. But even for popular pseudonymous blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, privacy possibilities are getting better all the while. That reality is not lost on many cryptoeconomy stakeholders, particularly blockchain analysis firms like CipherTrace and Chainalysis — companies that have proven increasingly ascendant as exchanges and governments have sought to better understand cryptoeconomy transaction flows.  Yet is that ascendancy on the verge of an existential challenge? It’s a question some in the space are mulling after a curious “Ask Me Anything” thread appeared in r/Bitcoin earlier this week before being promptly deleted. The AMA was held by a person purporting to be a “current or former employee of Chainalysis.” It’s unclear whether the user, dubbed Chainalysis1, was able to verify their identity with the subreddit’s moderators beyond a shadow of a doubt. It’s also unclear why they ultimately deleted the thread. With that said, their alleged insider knowledge should be approached with the appropriate level of skepticism, all things considered. Notably, before the thread’s deletion the purported employee answered several questions with answers suggesting the advance of cryptocurrency privacy tech was a devastating gamechanger for the blockchain analysis industry. And while the chance remains the AMA was an elaborate stunt, many of the answers were thought-provoking enough to be worth considering beyond the thread’s direct context. One user asked Chainalysis1 if their alleged employer would be able to weather the advance of privacy solutions like the Wasabi wallet, which leverages the CoinJoin mixing technique and multisig scripts to help users trustlessly hide their bitcoin’s origins among one another. “Things like that destroy the need for our/their software,” the purported employee answered, later adding: Asked by another Redditor what the firm’s “most hated tool” at present was, Chainalsysi1 specifically cited Wasabi wallet: Those are bold assertions, but they’re not necessarily ones that would take diehard cryptoverse privacy advocates by surprise. Rather, what is surprising is that these assertions come from someone claiming to have inside knowledge of one of the ecosystem’s top blockchain analysis firms. When asked later why they were conducting the AMA given the alleged circumstances, Chainalysis1 said “Transparency,” going on to say that such firms were unethical for “Defeating the purpose of a system that was designed for anonymity, thereby reducing the interest and market for crypto.” Yet not long after the thread went up, it went down — a version of its page is now only reachable via webpage archiving. To be sure, privacy coins like Monero already pose challenges for sleuths and regulators, while it’s becoming easier to use top public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum privately. Using Wasabi wallet in conjunction with Tor goes a long way toward making BTC transaction flows obscured, while Ethereum has recently seen major enterprises develop privacy tools for its public chain, e.g. EY’s Nightfall protocol and JP Morgan’s Anonymous Zether. Those dynamics alone indicate blockchain analysis firms have their work cut out for them in the years ahead.",

        "passage": "A recent report by the Financial Times has revealed that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have collaborated to launch a private blockchain network, which will enable “explorations and experimentations” into Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In addition to that, both institutions have reportedly created a digital asset, dubbed the “Learning Coin,” based on their joint blockchain network. The report claims that the Learning Coin was created as a tool to aid the institutions in their effort to better understand blockchain technology, including its function as an underlying technology for crypto assets.  However, while the asset does seem like it is a cryptocurrency, the Financial Times stresses that it isn’t exactly one. For one, the currency doesn’t have a monetary value, and it isn’t tied to any known fiat currency. In addition to that, the coin is only intended for use by IMF and World Bank staff as they pursue “a deeper knowledge” of blockchain technology. As such, the coin, as well as all of its properties and uses, will only be accessible within both institutions. Also, an application was also reported to have been developed by the institutions, and it is expected to accompany the Learning Coin’s use. The app would help staffers with research efforts, and it will support learning materials and content such as presentations, informational videos, and blog posts. Staff at both institutions were said to be earning Learning Coin tokens whenever they reach laid-out educational milestones in their blockchain experimentation and exploration efforts. Also, while the coin still doesn’t have any real-world or monetary value, workers at the institutions are said to be working on how employees can redeem their tokens in exchange for certain “rewards.” The news is coming less than a week after Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the IMF, stated that new and emerging technologies such as blockchain technology are having impacts on the stability of the global financial system. Lagarde’s expressed this sentiment while in an interview with news outlet CNBC at the 2019 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF in Washington D.C. on April 10. As part of her comments, the French policymaker had stated: She pointed out that central banks and financial regulators all over the world have recognized the potential of blockchain-based technologies to transform how the global financial system operates. Last year, Lagarde also encouraged the exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). In a speech at the Singapore FinTech Festival on November 14, Lagarde called for an increased issuance of CBDCs, pointing out a decrease in the demand for physical cash and the growing appeal for digital money. The IMF Chief also stated that major crypto assets are “vying for a spot in the cashless world, constantly reinventing themselves in the hope of offering more stable value, and quicker, cheaper settlement.” Also, last summer, the World Bank launched the first global blockchain-based bond settlement, raising $81 million in the process. The bond, which was handled by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank), had additional investors, including Northern Trust, the NSW Treasury Corporation, QBE Insurance, among others. In an official statement, CommBank stated that it was handling the bond with its own private Ethereum blockchain, and the Microsoft Corporation has reviewed its security and architecture. The two-year bond, which was dubbed the Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument (BONDI, in reference to Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach), was viewed as a first step towards moving bond transactions from manual processes to cheaper and faster-automated ones.",

        "passage": "Phony initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a big problem here and abroad. That’s why countries like the Bahamas are taking matters into their own hands and enforcing regulations to ensure they stop. Fraudulent ICOs have proven to be troublesome in both the United States and throughout the globe. While the ICO remains a popular and common tactic to obtain capital for new businesses, not all these ventures have honesty in their blueprints.  Many startups see ICOs as easy ways to garner funds quickly for their operations and employee wages, so they set up a fund in which investors can offer capital – usually in the form of ether or Ethereum-based tokens – in exchange for an entirely new coin, which they can then use to access the company’s goods and services. Though not all fall into this category, several of these startups seeking funding potentially disappear within months of the ICO, taking the money with them and leaving investors with less cash in their pockets. They stand with their pride broken, and all they have to their name is a coin that now serves no purpose in the investing world or beyond. It is estimated that approximately $500 million has been lost throughout 2018 alone to phony ICOs. That’s a very big number, and some countries are beginning to say, “no more.” One of those nations is the Bahamas. A cluster of islands in the middle of the Caribbean, the Bahamas is widely known as a tourist attraction, but has become a major cryptocurrency haven over the past year. One of the country’s biggest ventures involved releasing its own state-backed cryptocurrency. Now, it’s moving in a different direction by drafting one of the first official regulations built to battle phony ICOs. The document was created by the Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBOB), which says this will help the country as it prepares to integrate digital assets into its financial service offerings. CBOB believes that the cryptocurrency industry’s approach towards international regulation is “too fragmented,” which makes it difficult to handle or manage the emerging risks. Among the additional amendments in the regulatory framework include those designed to battle crimes like tax evasion and money laundering along with market volatility, one of the biggest problems plaguing the cryptocurrency space. The document is being molded based on recent suggestions made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). CBOB later stated: The country is working hard to build its reputation as a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain hub through its latest partnership with Cuba Ventures Corp. Blockchain Revolupay. The startup has decided that the Bahamas will be the center of its headquarters thanks to its solid IT infrastructure. The company announced last year that it would be setting up camp in the Caribbean state, and described the facility it was using to reporters:",

        "passage": "While the Ethereum ecosystem is still fledgling, one common complaint against its decentralized apps, or dapps, is that they’ve proven to be unfamiliar to mainstream users accustomed to regular apps not underpinned by blockchain tech. Unveiled on August 6th, the new Gas Station Network (GSN) aims to cut out complexity from dapps in becoming the “ultimate Ethereum onboarding solution.” How? The new network is an open-source solution designed to help dapps become “indistinguishable from your favorite Web 2.0 apps.” This figurative sleight of hand occurs as dapps that leverage GSN “can now assume the transaction costs of their users” according to a given project’s particular customer acquisition costs (CAC).  This dynamic makes it so that dapp users don’t have to deal with gas fees for transactions because a GSN-based dapp covers these costs right out of the gate. Of course, such a system is contingent on a dapp being able to sustainably afford these costs.  “GSN is not only a must for onboarding, but it is also the key that unlocks new and disruptive business models within the blockchain paradigm,” wrote Ramon Recuero, who formally revealed the network in a Medium post. The network was created through collaborations involving several Ethereum ecosystem stakeholders, such as digital asset security play TabooKey, the dapp DAO MetaCartel, and the OpenZeppelin project. Zooming in, the GSN relies on decentralized relayers — which can be run permissionlessly — to execute transactions. As Recuero explained: The advantages of this system, which now has a live beta on the Rinkeby testnet, is that through it users should no longer have to go through confusing, multi-step onboarding processes or deal directly with address keys. Another pain point native to transparent blockchain cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether is that, if you use addresses and associate them with public activity without resorting to privacy techniques, then anyone with an internet connection and the know-how to review a block explorer can audit your financial history. Consider how some Ethereum dapps and DAOs require public attestations on platforms like Twitter. In the past, to make such verifications with privacy, users would have to turn to or spin up an address they haven’t used in the past. However, many people would surely prefer to have a single consolidated address they could use for all things Ethereum without revealing the entirety of their on-chain activity. That’s where experimental privacy solutions like the Tornado mixer come in.  Tornado, which leverages zk-SNARKS privacy tech to obscure participants’ activity, was first unveiled in late July as a beta on the Kovan testnet. This week, Tornado was released on the Ethereum mainnet. The mixer has yet to be audited and should still be considered experimental, so use it at your own risk until further notice. Still, the project’s advancement comes as many in stakeholders in the Ethereum community have been grappling with how to bring better privacy to their blockchain. For example, Tornado’s testnet beta arrived not long after developer Kendrick Tan released his Heiswap mixer on the Ropsten testnet. Tan built Heiswap according to the minimal design specification that Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin outlined for a mixer back in the spring. These mixers are still early on in their lifespans, but they represent the possibility of Ethereum becoming increasingly private to use.",

        "passage": "As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has boomed, so have the number of incumbents of traditional finance and politics taking to the streets to bash cryptocurrency. In Washington, D.C. on Thursday, one American politician — and a prominent one at that —  suggested that cryptocurrencies should be banned. Yikes. (Note: there is some opinion scattered through this piece.)  During Thursday’s Financial Services Committee hearing, U.S. Congressman Bradley Sherman, who represents the Democrats in California — the home of technological innovation of all places — suddenly brought on cryptocurrencies. During his rant-esque statement, which was recorded by industry non-profit Coin Center, Sherman remarked that Congress should outlaw cryptocurrencies for U.S. citizens. He remarked: Sherman explained that cryptocurrencies are starting to enter the realm of “illicit finance”, specifically looking to how the Hamas militia is seeking funding through Bitcoin. He then goes on to describe Bitcoin’s premise as one built on libertarianism and anarchism, which is, to his credit, true. Yet, he goes on to represent the entire cryptocurrency space like it is predicated on tax evasion, drug dealing, and what have you, effectively forgetting to realize that this technological advancement is so much more than what he mentioned, not to mention that the U.S. dollar is used for questionable acts too. Furthering his narrative, Sherman jokes that “crypto is the plastic gun of currency.” He then concluded his statement by drawing attention to the fact that cryptocurrency undermines the value proposition of the U.S. dollar, quipping that something like Bitcoin could “disempower foreign policy, tax collection enforcement, and traditional law enforcement.” JP Morgan & Chase’s Jamie Dimon would surely be proud.  The funny thing about this, as pointed out by Twitter commentator The Crypto Dog, is that Sherman may be slightly hypocritical when using the “illicit finance” narrative. Although the Congressman has never participated in such heinous acts before, his campaign’s top funder is from a company that had to forfeit $13.3 million. What for, you ask? Well, apparently the company was involved in illegal online gambling, and thus was required to fork over that money to the Feds. What’s more, the campaign donor list for Sherman is spotted with American banks and traditional institutions, making it no surprise that he’s pushing back against an innovation that could usurp the foundation he stands upon. Color me surprised, I’ll wait.  We have covered Brad Sherman and his conflicts of interest before here on Blockonomi. This odd case of Bitcoin bashing, alongside a similar case seen just days ago with Nobel Prize-endowed economist Joseph Stiglitz, has resulted in the cryptocurrency community taking up arms. Not only does an event band the industry together. Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Capital hints at the fact that Sherman likely understands very little about Bitcoin, let alone cryptocurrency or blockchain, making it nonsensical to call for a ban. Pompliano added, “Bitcoin will be around long after Mr. Sherman.”  As industry journalist Kyle Torpey noted, Sherman’s attempt to spark anti-Bitcoin bills is actually a solid advertisement for the cryptocurrency, as it literally shows how scared the U.S. is of its dollar losing hegemony as the world’s go-to asset. Jimmy Song, an industry educator, adds that this is a clear sign that Bitcoin is reaching the point in its life during which those stuck in the past are trying to stop something inevitable, this being the rise of a sound, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and digital money that breaks all traditional boundaries.",

That same report found that Indeed job searches linked to the terms “cryptocurrency” and “bitcoin” have been steadily declining over the first quarter of 2019 after searches for both peaked last December.   At the time, “cryptocurrency” searches topped out at 46 searches per million, and “bitcoin” wasn’t far behind with 39 searches per million. These searches have respectively declined more than 40 percent and 75 percent over the last three months. It’s been a different story for “blockchain” job searches, however. Indeed’s Hiring Lab found that such queries hovered around the 47 searches-per-million mark during the same period time. To that end, Indeed noted that interest in the tech “remain[ing] high,” as well as the more generic possibilities of non-specific blockchain work, likely accounted for the consistent search trend:  Indeed Blockchain Job Searches, Source In their report, Indeed also found that the only bank in the top 10 companies making the biggest crypto and blockchain hiring pushes as of late also happened to be America’s largest — JP Morgan Chase. As such, Indeed discerned that JP Morgan was recently gunning for more blockchain hires than Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys and tech titan Microsoft — a dynamic that indicates the scope of the firm’s distributed ledger plans for the foreseeable future. Other international business powers like Cisco, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and IBM were among the enterprises attempting the most blockchain-centric hires, Indeed found. The drive to bring in crypto talent comes as no surprise, as JP Morgan made waves in the cryptoeconomy last month in announcing the launch of JPM Coin, a stablecoin for international payments settlements being created by the firm. Bear market or not, big companies have been making big blockchain hires this year. For example, speculation exploded a few weeks ago that staking services were coming to Coinbase after the exchange hired Luke Youngblood, the architect of Tezos’s staking system. And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what’s happened now that Coinbase Custody has revealed its staking and governance operations. Silicon Valley mainstays Facebook and Square have also been trying to make blockchain tech hiring inroads. Earlier this month, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the new Square Crypto service was looking to hire some cryptocurrency engineers and a designer.  Around the same time, a job posting on the Facebook Careers page appeared for a “Lead Commercial Counsel, Blockchain” position. The work would center around legally fostering Facebook’s commercial blockchain-based ventures. Last month, Facebook’s blockchain team also “acqui-hired” a handful of smart contracts experts from the Chainspace project — a potential staffing boon to their reported plans to make a Facebook coin or similar assets in the future. You don’t have to work at Facebook or JP Morgan if you want to work in crypto. Those hunting for blockchain work have plenty of helpful online resources to turn to, including crypto jobs boards like CryptoJobs, Crypto Jobs List, and Coinmonks Jobs. More mainstream boards like Indeed, AngelList, and Upwork are also options. It’s not clear when the current bear cycle will end, but you can bet that crypto-related job postings will boom on these sites in kind when it does.",

        "passage": "Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations within the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry is something that exchanges can no longer ignore, especially if the platform in question has a gateway that facilitates fiat currency. With a lack of infrastructure in place to stream-line the process, verifying a user’s identity can be a somewhat slow and inefficient procedure. Recognizing the need to fast-track this process, Australia Post, the country’s national postage company, have recently launched a new product that will allow cryptocurrency exchanges to complete KYC validation within just a few minutes.  Known as “Digital iD”, the service will alleviate the need for customers to wait days on end before they are able to access their newly created account. Under current AML regulations in Australia, cryptocurrency exchanges are required to identify the customers that use their platform. This will most commonly consist of a Government issued ID (such as a passport or driving license) and in some cases, a proof of address (such as a bank statement). The concept involves Australian citizens undergoing a one-time registration process with Digital iD, which once confirmed, allows users to confirm their identity with a click of button. Although this will initially see the user upload a range of documentation with Digital iD, once the process is complete they will be able to verify their identify with any merchant that accepts the technology. Not only does this benefit the cryptocurrency exchange platforms themselves, insofar that there is no longer a need to install hugely expensive KYC departments, but it will also reduce the underlying security risks for the user. The reason for this is that there is no need to continuously distribute sensitive documents online. If falling in to the wrong hands, it would potentially allow a bad actor to perform identity fraud.  An additional option that Digital iD users have is that they can decide how much of their personal information they want to share with a particular merchant. For example, if a vendor only requires confirmation that the customer is above the age of 18, the Digital iD user can opt to simply share their name and date of birth, rather than needlessly sharing their driving license and proof of address. This could also be useful in the event that a cryptocurrency exchange requires enhanced customer due diligence on a user, which typically arises when larger volumes are transacted, or a particular withdrawal request surpasses a certain amount. The Digital iD team have already formed a notable partnership with Australian cryptocurrency exchange Digital Surge. The platform not only allows users to buy, sell and trade a range of cryptocurrencies, but they also offer users the opportunity to pay Australian utility bills via Bitcoin. On top of the Digital Surge partnership, Digital iD are also close to securing a deal with two additional Australian-based cryptocurrency exchanges, notably Coin Loft and Coinjar. With the barriers of KYC and AML obligations significantly eased, the Digital iD concept could bring a new wave of interested parties in to the cryptocurrency industry. For one, some sectors of society simply do not feel comfortable uploading personal documentation to a platform with very little trading history, especially in an industry that is often a victim of external hacks. However, with the backing of Australian Post, an organization with an established reputation that dates back more than 200 years, the aforementioned reluctance may no longer be an issue. The Digital iD application is available to download for free via the Google Play or Apple iTunes store.",

        "passage": "You’ve probably come across the term securities before. Recently the US Government agency that deals with securities, known as the SEC or Securities and Exchange Commission, has been increasingly getting involved in cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, SEC chairman Jay Clayton made several comments about ICOs at a US Senate hearing. Specifically, he said that “every ICO I’ve seen is a security”. The word “security” is important here because defining anything as such means that it is subject to a complex set of laws and regulations. If cryptocurrencies are successfully labeled as securities, it means that in the US, they will be required to be fully compliant with all SEC regulations and applicable laws.  A security, in a broad sense, refers to financial instruments that are based on debt or equity. A debt security would be something like a bond or a CD. In these cases, owning a debt security means that someone or something owes you money. In the case of a bond, a city bond would mean that the city who issued it owes you, the owner, a certain amount of money to be repaid within the official schedule of the bond. The other type of security is called an equity security. Equity, in this case, means part ownership of a company. The classic example of this is shares of stock in a company. If you own a share of Microsoft stock, then you are a part owner of the company.  U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission Website Things start to get more confusing once you dig into cryptocurrencies. Let’s look at bitcoin. If you own bitcoin, you are not entitled to any particular debt or deposits. There is no repayment schedule, and there is no issuer from which the debt should eventually come from. Therefore it’s safe to conclude that bitcoin is not a debt security. Likewise, as bitcoin is not a company, a bitcoin does not represent a share of ownership in anything. Bitcoin is valued simply because bitcoin itself has value. For this reason, bitcoin is generally not considered a security, but instead is considered an asset more in line with gold or diamonds. It’s something that has value in and of itself and is not tied to any company or issuing body. Things get even more complicated when we consider the various cryptocurrencies and ERC-20 tokens offered in ICO’s. This is because practically all ICO’s are offered by an individual or a company. Even if it’s not offered by a registered company, it’s still being offered by an individual or group of individuals that will be the beneficiary of the proceeds from the sale. As Clayton of the SEC believes that practically all ICO’s are securities, this could have important consequences on US citizens. Beyond the US, eventually, citizens of most countries that comply directly or indirectly with the US legal system may also be affected. In the same hearing, Clayton responded to a prompting by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, where he suggested that ICO’s as they exist today are “a violation of the law”.  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, Image from Omaha.com Are ICO’s illegal? At this point, not quite. In order for an ICO to be illegal in the United States, it would need to be de facto declared as a security first. Once that is done, attempting to sell securities without following SEC procedures could be viewed as an illegal act. Today, however, the situation is far more gray than it is black and white. While SEC Chairman Clayton may believe that ICO’s are securities, this concept has not yet been fully solidified in US law. Due to enhanced scrutiny, a number of US-based ICO’s have been extremely careful with their wording. For example, some have refrained from using the term “ICO “at all. They are instead using more ambiguous phrasing such as “crowd sale” or “token generating event”. They have also refrained from referring to their tokens as currency and instead have been using other phrases. Salt Lending, a Denver based company that had an ICO previously, now refers to their ERC-20 tokens as “memberships”. They also strictly forbid the discussion of exchange prices or price speculation in their official Telegram chat. Users who do so find themselves quickly banned. When members in the chat asked why they’re not allowed to discuss prices, the moderators are quick to spit out a response with a prewritten message about the SEC and legal liabilities.  For quite some time now, Americans have found themselves restricted or denied access to many highly profitable ICO’s. If they are not outright restricted, then they are often required to be “accredited investors”. Basically speaking, accredited investor is a code word for wealthy elite. Those who are not accredited investors are what’s known as retail investors. All of this is again due to SEC regulations which, in theory, were put in place to protect retail investors from losing all their money to overly risky investments. Let’s pose a hypothetical scenario. Imagine that a consumer buys a pasta maker online. Once the device arrives, they realize that for whatever reason, the pasta maker doesn’t work, or it is of such poor quality that it breaks almost immediately after use. In a case like this, how much influence should a government have? In order to protect consumers, should the government create a Pasta maker Quality Commission or PQC? Should any company that wants to make pasta makers need to go through many years of extensive registration, requiring an army of lawyers and millions of dollars in legal fees? Now let’s say that companies realize quickly that they can get around the regulations imposed by the PQC by simply calling their devices “Italian-style noodle makers”. At that point, the legal language would need to change to define what a pasta maker actually is, and all the manufacturers would need to do is just make sure that their arbitrary language for describing their machines stays one step ahead of the regulation. But would of all this really be necessary? Wouldn’t it make a lot more sense if consumers relied on their own best judgment, the reviews of others, or even the reputation of the brand instead of needing an overbearing government body in order to “protect” them? To make things worse, what if only the wealthy elite were allowed to purchase low cost and highly efficient pasta makers that weren’t registered by the PQC, and normal people were only allowed to buy highly expensive, out-dated, and overly simplified models that the PQC approved of? This example may seem silly, but it’s not that far off from what is going on with the SEC, and the opportunities that ICO’s represent to retail investors. In the past, only the wealthy elite were given access to the best, most exciting, and the most potentially profitable investments. That all changed when anyone was able to buy Ether for less than a dollar. Suddenly, anyone regardless of their financial status was able to invest in what was arguably one of the most important financial events of the century. While the SEC regulations may exist for a good reason, at least in theory, they may be quickly becoming obsolete and unnecessary. The SEC claims that their goal is to protect retail investors from scams and fraudsters. But if that were true, why does the law allow for the wealthy elite to make such investments? Today’s retail investor is savvier than ever thanks to the internet and the multitude of tools available to them. Perhaps it’s time for the SEC to reconsider their stance on ICO’s, and to put their faith in the wisdom and caution that retail investors can muster up. While some ICO’s may be scams, locking all retail investors out of them will do nothing but ensure that only the wealthy elite have the best investment opportunites.",

        "passage": "Whilst it is often said that the vast bulk of consumer interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is based on speculative financial gain, it is always refreshing to see its usage considered for the greater cause. This is exactly what innovators at IBM are hoping to achieve, with a recent pilot test to ascertain whether blockchain and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies can help track groundwater usage in the U.S. state of California.  In collaboration with not-for-profit organization the Freshwater Trust and satellite sensor provider SweetSense, the IBM project is looking to tackle unsustainable usage of groundwater. The key reason that California has been targeted is that the location hosts one of the most at-risk aquifers in the U.S. In effect, the idea behind the project is to utilize IoT sensors to transmit groundwater usage levels in real-time. In order to obtain the data seamlessly and securely, the IoT sensors will transfer the data to the underlying IBM blockchain system. As such, the data is immutable to error, amendment or malpractice. The team at IBM are also hoping to utilize smart contract technology, which will allow the system to execute data when certain pre-defined if/when conditions are met. Specifically, the project will extract data from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, which covers in the region of 1,100 square miles. It is also important to note that the river is home to a significant quantity of animal and plant species, including legally protected fish. The IBM-backed partnership has also indicated that they plan to integrate a central dashboard that will allow a range of stakeholders – notably regulatory bodies, financiers and farmers, to access the real-time groundwater data. Further down the line, if the project is a success, the technology may be used to utilize the buying and selling of groundwater shares. This will essentially allow regulatory bodies to encourage sustainable groundwater usage levels. For example, should a stakeholder purchase groundwater shares, but subsequently use more levels than their shares enables, they can simply purchase more shares from other stakeholders who have a surplus supply. Nathan Wangusi of IBM Research Africa explains that the concept being trialed in California could potentially make the transition over to African-based farmers. In what Wangusi refers to as ‘Groundwater Credit’, the researcher added the technology will enable farmers to trade water sources on a peer-to-peer basis.  Moreover, the IBM researcher was also quoted as saying “The blockchain allows for visibility of water extraction and keeps a tight ledger on this, while helping with transparency and the ability to trade assets.” Whilst the aforementioned pilot test is certainly admirable, this isn’t the first time that IBM have created initiatives to make the world a better place. In September last year, we reported that IBM was driving an innovative program to trace contamination along the food supply chain. It was noted that leading U.S. based supermarket chain Walmart would be integrating the technology in to their systems. The program dictates that leafy-green vegetable providers that plan to sell their goods to Walmart must use the IBM-backed blockchain tracking platform. Furthermore, at the turn of 2019 it was announced that IBM would be piloting a blockchain project to ensure that Cobalt is sourced in an ethical manner. Cobalt is a highly demanded mineral that is used to power mobile phones, laptops and other electrical device. By utilizing blockchain technology, the IBM project hopes to trace and validate Cobalt purchases along the supply chain.",

        "passage": "From yesterday’s low at around $121B the evaluation of the cryptocurrency market cap has increased today by 11 billion dollars measured to the current levels.  As you can see from the global chart the evaluation has broken out from the major resistance and is currently in an upward trajectory. Consequently, the market is in green with an average percentage of increase ranging around 9%. The biggest gainers are in double digits and the most notable increase among top 100 coins is Bitcoin Private with an increase of 40.59% in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has stayed around the same levels which indicates that the new capital has spread into the market widely as to include the altcoins who previously saw a decrease.  From yesterday’s low at $3785.5 the price of Bitcoin has increased by 12.38% measured to the current levels of $4226.  Looking at the hourly chart you can see that the price has indeed found its bottom yesterday on the third interaction with the horizontal support level at $3783.7. Since the final corrective Z wave has ended an impulsive 12345 in the upward direction begun and judging by the sub-waves it has a bit more to go potentially for another interaction with the horizontal resistance level at $4247 before undergoing a small correction. In the upcoming period, I would be expecting that the price pulls back a bit at first and then continue going upward to retest the descending channels support levels for resistance. Market sentiment Hourly chart technicals are signaling a buy.  Pivot points S3 2572.1 S2 3307.9 S1  3762.5 P 4498.3 R1 5234.1 R2 5688.7 R3 6424.5 From yesterday’s low at $267.49 the price of Bitcoin Cash has increased by 12.97% as the cryptocurrency is currently being traded at $303.  Looking at the hourly chart you can see a similar upward structure like in the case of Bitcoin. At the moment we can see that the price has reached the horizontal resistance line at $ 306.3 and the interaction with it resulted with a small decrease for now. As you can see the price action has formed a U shape which indicates a bottom and considering the horizontal level will serve as resistance we are now likely going to see a retracement which would be in combination with the U shape bottom a cup and handle pattern. After a pullback, I would be expecting that the price continues in an upward trajectory but we are yet to see how high will this recovery go. Market sentiment  Bitcoin Cash hourly chart technical indicators are bullish, with moving averages signaling a strong buy.

On the hourly chart, you can see that the price has broken the major resistance line much like it did on the charts of two major cryptos previously analyzed. Currently, the price is in an upward trajectory since a small pullback which is what I am expecting to see now for the price of Bitcoin Cash. The next horizontal resistance level in line is at the prior range support which is at $64.645. The price could stop increasing here because as you can see by the wick from the upside the selling pressure has already being experienced. Market sentiment Monero is in the buy zone.

Looking at the global chart you can see the similarities in the structure with all the major cryptos as well as the minor once. It looks like the down move has ended and that the recovery has started. First major resistance the evaluation has encountered and is currently struggling to pass is the prior lower high level. I believe that the evaluation will pullback to retest downtrend’s resistance line for support from which an increase is to be made to the next horizontal resistance level which is at around $142,571B and is the support from the consolidation range. After the interaction with the mentioned level we will see and evaluate the potential behind the upward move.",

        "passage": "You can count on the Sichuan Basin in Northwestern China being rainy every autumn. The question is: how rainy? This year, the seasonal downpours are proving particularly torrential, as extreme flooding in recent days has led to evacuations and fatalities in the region. Also affected have been bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining operations in the area, according to local reports. Notably, Sichuan is one of the world’s biggest centers for bitcoin mining activity.  Red Li, co-founder of Chinese crypto publication 8btc, confirmed that a few mining facilities appeared to be “wiped out” from the flooding. Li posted to Twitter several photos depicting destroyed local infrastructure and washed out, mud-covered bitcoin mining rigs.  The Beijing-based Poolin, currently the fourth largest bitcoin mining pool in the world, also highlighted the catastrophe. The company posted videos to its Twitter account showing what appeared to be a Sichuan mining facility being enveloped by flooding and workers digging through muddy rigs in the aftermath.  Back in June, cryptocurrency research company Coinshares published a report suggesting the majority of the world’s bitcoin mining operations are powered by renewable energy sources. With that said, many Chinese miners rely on hydropower for cheap renewable energy. That cheap hydropower has a catch: it depends on Chinese wet seasons being wet. Many of these miners and their businesses depend on being located in areas where heavy seasonal rain is not just the norm, but the needed reality. If Sichuan was dry year round, miners wouldn’t be relying on hydropower there (but solar power would then be an option). So sometimes when it rains it pours, and when disastrous amounts of rainfall hit popular mining centers in China, these operations’ lifesource becomes a possible death knell like was seen this week. Some Sichuan mining facilities were notably rocked by flooding last year, too — it’s the name of the game, it seems. Fortunately, the damage appears to have been isolated to a few facilities. Among other things, that means the Bitcoin hash rate hasn’t been affected much by the flooding. As of August 21st, the hash rate hovered around 77.5 quintillion hashes per second according to Blockchain.com — not far from the 82.5 quintillion hashes per second seen on August 18th. Flooding in Sichuan hardly qualifies as a black swan event because such flooding is almost expected to happen. Still, mining operations that take preparations against the region’s seasonal fury can still find their efforts reduced to rubble by nature’s power because only so much can be done in the face of natural disasters. Flooding can hit hard and fast and acutely take local populaces by surprise, for one. Zooming out on bitcoin, for the cryptocurrency to work as a non-sovereign global money system, it has to be able to keep chugging along even if parts of its network are affected by disasters or black swan events. If a central spoke on the centralized VISA network got affected by a hack or extreme weather, an entire continent of users might lose access to their money for a time. On the flip side, flooding can hit a bitcoin mining capital and Bitcoin doesn’t even come close to losing any uptime. Such anti-fragility is one of the cryptocurrency’s biggest value propositions. Some disregard the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining because they point to the network’s reliance on renewable energy. But it’s not so simple, and China’s weather patterns show why. When rainy seasons give way to dry seasons in China, many miners shift from using hydropower to burning fossil fuels, e.g. through coal plants. PwC blockchain expert Alex de Vries has previously argued that dynamic could lead to the “construction of new coal-based power plants” in China, which would grow Bitcoin’s environmental implications.",

        "passage": "Abra – the world’s first and only all-in-one digital wallet and cryptocurrency exchange – has announced its support for Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) bank accounts. European customers can now enable direct wire transfers from assorted European banks to purchase any of Abra’s 28 available cryptocurrencies.  Founded in the year 2014, Abra seeks to provide users with 100 percent privacy and control over their digital finances. The application is non-custodial, which means the wallet’s private keys are never held by anyone other than the actual customer. Abra is completely peer-to-peer and cuts out all middlemen, so customer funds are never touched, managed or even viewed by third parties. Past and present investors in Abra include First Round Capital, Arbor Ventures and RRE Ventures. CEO Billy Barhydt exclaims: Abra wallets were initially funded using both wire and bank transfers in the United States. Customers could also purchase cryptocurrencies using either debit or credit cards. The platform’s integration of SEPA will now give several European Union nations the opportunity to deposit either euros or 50 separate national fiat currencies into their Abra wallets for use towards crypto purchases. Among the countries now privy to this service are Cyprus, Austria, Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany and Italy. Upon transferring fiat currency to their Abra wallets, European customers will see their money instantly transformed into bitcoin, which can then be stored safely and securely in their Abra accounts or traded at any time for one of the platform’s many altcoin offerings. Abra has also announced that it is adding three more cryptocurrencies – Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Tron (TRX) – to its growing trading system. Abra currently allows users to invest in several major tokens such as bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, bitcoin cash and Dogecoin among others. Barhydt states: The cryptocurrency arena in Europe is garnering quite a bit of attention as of late. Bruegel – a Brussels-based think tank – recently stated its belief that Europe can no longer hold out digital currency’s popularity and must move fast to adopt widespread regulation. The organization recently issued a report that acknowledges fear of financial crime such as money laundering and fraud, while also praising cryptocurrencies for their anonymity, low transaction fees and ease of access. Bruegel is now calling upon the European Union to create a full playbook regarding digital assets, so the public can both understand and use them to their full potential. Meanwhile, a summit amongst EU leaders in countries such as France and Germany will occur later this week in Austria’s capital of Vienna. Though full details are not yet clear, officials are slated to discuss further integration of blockchain technology, while developing warning mechanisms for investors regarding the dangers and uncertainties behind crypto. Thus far, state governments in Europe have failed to take legitimate actions regarding cryptocurrency trading, thereby leaving decisions in the hands of local regulators. This has provided strong leeway in Europe’s growing cryptocurrency space by allowing digital asset ventures to pick up and move to less stringent regions before regulators can move.",

        "passage": "It seems that 2019 is already shaping up to be a solid year for the cryptocurrency industry. Sources tell Bloomberg that one of the world’s largest asset managers will soon offer Bitcoin (BTC) trading to its tens of thousands of institutional clients, setting the stage for a large capital inflow into digital assets.  In late-October of 2018, Fidelity Investments, a Boston-based financial services provider, revealed that it would be launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS) — a branch focused solely on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. And since the announcement, stakeholders the industry over have waited eagerly for FDAS’ inaugural day in operation. But during the months that followed, headlines around the Fidelity subsidiary slowed, and some cynics speculated that it was nothing but a marketing ploy. However, this changed with hearsay in February. As reported by Blockonomi, insiders told Bloomberg that FDAS’ first product, a fully-fledged Bitcoin custody solution, was slated to launch in March if final testing turned out well. As the branch’s chief, Tom Jessop, told reporters later, the rumor was true, confirming that Fidelity was securing BTC for its clients. Yet the company will soon branch out from being a cryptocurrency custodian. New reports, namely one from Bloomberg posted Monday, divulge that the option to conduct cryptocurrency purchases and sales will soon be available on FDAS. Those familiar with the matter told the outlet that “within a few weeks,” the institutional clientele will have access to the aforementioned solution. It isn’t clear if Fidelity will be offering spot market trading or some darkpool/over-the-counter (OTC) solution to its clients. Yet, as explained by a company representative, the service will be “focused on Bitcoin.” She further adds: This news comes just days after Fidelity unveiled an institutional survey they commissioned, which revealed that institutions are widely amicable towards the digital asset class. Out of the “more than 400 U.S. institutional investors” polled, 47% agreed that cryptocurrencies should have a place in their portfolios. Out of that pro-crypto group, which included pensions, family offices, crypto funds, and endowments, 72% noted that they would be most comfortable with holding digital asset funds, like the array of proposed Bitcoin ETFs and Grayscale’s GBTC. On the matter of why a cryptocurrency allocation is logical, the institutions among the 47% noted that they see cryptocurrencies as innovative technology and an asset class barely correlated with traditional markets (asymmetrical risk) and has “appealing characteristics”.  No matter of FDAS’ launch goes well or not, all this goes to show that the American financial giant is committed to cryptocurrency. Ari Paul, the founder & chief investment officer of BlockTower Capital, would agree with this cheery sentiment. In a tweet posted in late-March, Paul, who (in)famously made a $1 million bet that BTC was going to surmount $50,000 by 2018’s end, notes that there are “hundreds of passionate advocates” for cryptocurrency at Fidelity, from the C-suite to the lower rungs of the executive ladder. In fact, Paul states that in 2015, the chief executive of the institution herself, the esteemed Abigail Johnson, was personally mining Bitcoin, right in her lofty office. He adds that there are more crypto-focused staffers at Fidelity than the “five biggest industry funds combined.”  This might not be hearsay either. In an episode of “Unconfirmed” with industry journalist Laura Shin, Jessop stated that his company has an R&D branch that has eyed cryptocurrencies since 2013-2014. He even quips that once upon a time, the company even had an internal pilot that allowed employees to purchase food for Bitcoin, underscoring Fidelity’s long-standing support for what many traditional economists have deemed the devil’s spawn. It is as clear as day that Fidelity doesn’t intend to slow its foray into cryptocurrency anytime soon, that’s for sure.",

        "passage": "Brad Sherman seems to be a fierce opponent of cryptocurrency. He recently made numerous public comments on cryptos, but they can all be summed up by this telling quote, The idea that cryptos are solely used for malfeasance is, of course, preposterous. Any negotiable instrument can be used for legal, or illegal transactions. Today cryptocurrency can be used much in the same way that fiat currency that is created by central banks is used. The one big problem for bank-backed politicians like Brad Sherman is that cryptos cut out the intermediaries. As Brad Sherman mistakenly asserts, “there is nothing that can be done with cryptocurrency that cannot be done with sovereign currency.” This is a blatantly false statement from a man that is directly supported by third-party settlement companies. Cryptocurrency can be used for things that, “sovereign currency,” simply can’t.  An Argentine bank, Banco Masventas, proved this when they replaced SWIFT with Bitcoin. Instead of submitting to a payment system that is controlled by the global central banks, Banco Masventas uses Bitcoin to make large, international currency transfers. This new use for Bitcoin is far cheaper than SWIFT, and accomplishes the transaction in a day. In a sense Brad Sherman is right, the SWIFT system almost never allows for transactions with sovereign currency to be made quickly. Like many things in the established financial system, SWIFT has gotten by with a de-facto monopoly for decades, and now that looks like it could be changing. No one in their right mind would assert that cryptocurrency offers nothing in addition to central bank created fiat currency. It should come as no surprise that Brad Sherman’s largest campaign donations in his last reelection bid came from Allied Wallet, which is a credit card payment processor. In other words, one of the industries that is most at-risk from cryptocurrency adoption at a consumer level. When a crypto investor who goes by the name of “CryptoDog” on Twitter mentioned this connection between Brad Sherman and Allied wallet to the Twitterverse, he was promptly told to, “STOP,” by none other than Brad Sherman himself. Clearly, Brad Sherman seems a little touchy about the potential for pay-for-play allegations.   Unfortunately for Congressman Sherman, statements like this make his opinions look very compromised It has been pointed out many, many times that currencies like the US Dollar can be used for illegal purposes. Pretty any medium of exchange can be used by criminals, but the US banking system is equally likely to engage in corrupt, illegal acts that help to support terrorism and fraud. The US Government takes a harsh view of Iran, and yet, under President Obama they transferred more than a billion US dollars to Iran, in cash. Iran has been identified by the US government as a state sponsor of terrorism, which makes this massive cash transaction look pretty strange. Given how easy it is to pick up a nuclear warhead in Bulgaria, the entire sideshow around the Iranian nuclear program is deranged, now that Iran has so many US dollars sitting around. There are also multiple instances of major money center banks like JP Morgan helping to launder money, and numerous other illegal acts. The amount of money that JP Morgan has paid in federal fines under CEO Jamie Dimon is in the tens of billions of USD, which would suggest no small amount of wrongdoing on their part. Part of the reason why cryptocurrencies may be so popular with the younger generations is the level of dishonesty that is present in major governments. It would be hard to take anything that Brad Sherman says about cryptocurrencies seriously, given his connections to banking, and obvious hate for an incredible new technology.",

        "passage": "Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the country’s first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) portal as it prepares the way for the establishment of a regulated cryptocurrency fundraising space. The regulators also say detailed guidelines concerning securities token offerings (STO) are being prepared. This news is the latest positive development concerning cryptocurrency regulation in Southeast Asia as the adoption of the emerging digital economy continues to take shape in the region  According to the Bangkok Post, the board of directors of the Thai SEC has approved the first-ever ICO portal in the country. Commenting on the development, Archari Suppiroj, the head of the Commission’s fintech division said that relevant government parastatals were in the process of finalizing approval for the ICO portal. Suppiroj did not provide the name of the approved ICO portal but said that it was being operated by a foreign-based company. According to Suppiroj, about eight companies applied to the SEC for approval to establish ICO portals in the country. ICO portals form part of the sweeping regulations introduced by Thailand in mid-2018. These portals provide a screening platform for ICOs, as well as verifying other compliance requirements such as know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, and smart contract source codes. The Thai SEC fintech chief also declared that the ICOs would soon take off in the country. Elaborating further, Suppiroj opined: Back in August 2019, as many as 50 ICO projects expressed interests in obtaining licenses from regulators to carry out their cryptocurrency fundraising campaigns. In May 2018, the country temporarily banned ICOs while it was in the process of creating a firm regulatory framework for the industry as a whole. According to Suppiroj the efforts of the SEC to regulate the ICO space has begun to bear dividends. Suppiroj declared that ICOs projects are pivoting away from projects with minimal utility to ICOs backed by physical assets like real estate. The Thai SEC is also reportedly looking at issuing regulatory guidelines for STOs. Back in February 2019, the country’s legislature approved an amendment to Thailand’s securities law to allow for STOs. Commenting on STO regulations in the country, Suppiroj declared: Suppiroj believes that once STO guidelines are adequately firmed up, issuers will be able to offer security tokens in the country’s primary market. With ICO season set to kick off in earnest in Thailand, potential investors will need to acquaint themselves with the regulatory and compliance measures initiated by the government. Recently, the Thai SEC updated its list of approved cryptocurrencies for ICOs and trading. As part of the update, the regulator banned Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic being used for ICOs or as base pairs in cryptocurrency trading. According to a statement from the Thai SEC, the removal of those three cryptocurrencies wasn’t indicative of the government placing a blanket ban on the respective virtual currencies. The Thai SEC at the time of the announcement also revealed that the move was not likely to have any negative impact on ICOs and trading. According to the Commission, ICOs were yet to take off and no local exchange platform used any of the delisted tokens as base pairs for trading on their platforms.",

In a recent missive the famed economist decided to unleash another torrent of hate against cryptos, blockchain and anyone who doesn’t have a seemingly pathological disgust for what he calls, “nothing more than an Excel spreadsheet or a database with a misleading name.” Nouriel Roubini didn’t feel like stopping at weighing in on a technology, and chose to make sweeping statements that are as absurd as they are inaccurate. This passage from his article is absolutely choice,  The idea that blockchain is a “byword” for libertarian ideology is wildly absurd. Blockchain-based platforms are being patented by most major banks, and international powerhouse IBM is actively working to implement blockchain platforms with partners like Walmart. It would be hard to find a global corporation that was less libertarian than Walmart, or the global money-center banks. Let’s get this out of the way, cryptos were never, “the mother of all bubbles.” At their peak the entire sector was worth under a trillion USD, which isn’t even as large as Apple, based on their market cap at the time of writing. Bitcoin is a revolutionary way to use the internet, and no one can ever take that away. Will Bitcoin be the next global financial system? Probably not. In all likelihood, Bitcoin was never designed to replace the world’s banking system. It has spurred massive development across numerous innovation hubs, like Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, and Thailand, which is impressive for a technology that came into existence around a decade ago. The World Bank is also issuing bonds on a blockchain platform, but Mr. Roubini doesn’t seem to be too concerned with reality at this point.  Read: World Bank Partners With CBA to Issue Blockchain Bonds There is no denying the fact that there is a lot of money being spent on developing blockchain platforms that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency. Faced with this, Nouriel Roubini seems to be pulling a page from Orwell’s 1984, and redefining words so they fit into his worldview. Never mind the fact his definition of blockchain requires you dive into the cognitive dissonance pool head first, and read on, “Moreover, in cases where distributed-ledger technologies – so-called enterprise DLT – are actually being used, they have nothing to do with blockchain. They are private, centralized, and recorded on just a few controlled ledgers. They require permission for access, which is granted to qualified individuals. And, perhaps most important, they are based on trusted authorities that have established their credibility over time. All of which is to say, these are “blockchains” in name only.” If you can swallow that line of thought, North Korea might have work for you in their Ministry of Truth, or whatever they call their propaganda creation department. Mr. Roubini also applied the GINI coefficient to the Bitcoin economy, as though it was a real country. The damnation of Bitcoin went further and included allegations of white male billionaires acting as messiahs, as well as crypto market transaction price fixing by nations like China and Russia. Last year was all about hating cryptos and blockchain. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon did it, and China was right there with him. Today JP Morgan is patenting blockchain technology, and China is doing a lot to support blockchain development. Hong Kong has decided that blockchain developers are worth creating emigration exemptions for, and the blockchain start-up funding market in Singapore is white hot. By today’s standards, cryptos were never that big of a bubble (clearly last December’s crypto prices were bubbly, viewed on a relative basis). Now all the cryptos combined might be worth a quarter trillion dollars, which is about half of what Facebook is selling for at the moment. So, you know, not a big market. More than a decade ago when Nouriel Roubini was railing against synthetic bonds, he was talking about a massive market that was fragile enough to make the global financial system grind to a halt. He went against the grain, was correct, and gained a lot of credibility as a result. Now he is building another intellectual position, but he is taking much bigger risks on a much smaller market which is clearly thriving. One wonders why.",

        "passage": "The new and increasingly popular crypto-backed cash loan service, Nexo, has announced that starting July 1, 2018, the platform will begin accepting deposits of Binance Coin for use as both loan collateral and loan repayment. This is a significant step for both platforms as it potentially allows for crypto investors to be able to get access to cash without needing to sell during bear markets like the one we are in now, and use Binance Coin for doing so. Nexo is a financial services platform that runs on Ethereum. It is, in some ways, similar to Salt Lending. However, Nexo has a few key advantages over Salt, not the least of which is they appear to be nearly fully functional right now. Salt, on the other hand, has been sputtering and has largely failed to do much anything.  So what are crypto-backed cash loans? Here’s how they usually work. Let’s say that you’re holding crypto assets like bitcoin or Ethereum, but you need cash for some reason. However, you decide that you don’t want to sell your crypto assets, and instead you would prefer to keep them. With a crypto-backed loan, you sign up for an account at a provider and then deposit your assets there. Once your deposits are in, you can request a cash loan which if approved will be deposited directly into your bank account within a few days. There are a few reasons why this kind of loan is superior to traditional alternatives. First, this system does not rely in any way on traditional credit scores that are used by banks and credit card issuers. This is because the loan that is given to you is a secured loan. This means that the lender is not taking on any significant risk by lending to you. Second, getting a crypto loan does not affect your credit score. In many cases if you were to take out a personal loan from a bank, it would negatively affect your credit score as it would increase the amount of debt you have. Third, this kind of money is what’s known as “hard money”. That being, it could be used towards making a down payment on a car or a house. You could not do that with a credit card or a personal loan from a bank as the banks could clearly see that you already borrowed money from them and are attempting to give it back to them in order to borrow even more. Finally, as these loans are fully secured (meaning if you fail to repay, the lender still can recover all of their lost value by selling your collateral), they tend to have far superior interest rates to other types of loans, especially if you have average or worse credit. What’s even more poignant about these kinds of services is that when markets are in a downturn, you may face a circumstance where you are forced to sell your assets at the bottom. This means not only do you have to sell, but you lose all of the value that your assets could have had once the market recovered. Having the option of getting a crypto loan means that in bad market conditions, you no longer need to sell when it is not favorable to you just because your life circumstances require cash. Now that we know how crypto-backed loans work, let’s take a look at some of the specifics of Nexo’s offering. Nexo boasts a fully automated lending system. This means that once you have verified your identity, you may deposit collateral assets and then be automatically qualified for a loan instantly. Again, there are no credit checks involved so all that matters is that your ID is verified and your assets are sufficient. Nexo requires a minimum of $1000 per loan to be issued, so keep this in mind if you just want a small loan for a few hundred dollars. Nexo might not be the right choice for this type of loan. The annual percentage interest rate (APR) starts at 8% (when using the NEXO tokens as collateral or as repayment) and is capped at 16% APR when not utilizing NEXO Tokens. No minimum loan repayments are required. Specifically, Nexo tokens can be used as collateral on the loan (in whole, or in part) and can also be used to repay a loan itself. If Nexo is used either as collateral or as a repayment mechanism, then the interest rate cuts to 8%. While this does sound interesting, Nexo tokens are not widely available yet. Currently, they are only available on a handful of exchanges. In fact, some exchanges, including some decentralized ones like Idex, have delisted Nexo on purpose. The reason why is because Nexo is in fact a security token, and intentionally so. Nexo tokens are surprisingly a legal, SEC compliant, registered security token. This means they are among the first of this type of token to gain a legitimate security standing. As a security token, Nexo tokens give out dividends to those who hold it, pass an identity check, and deposit their tokens into their Nexo account and not just any Ethereum wallet or exchange. It would appear that this dividend feature has not been activated yet and payments have not gone out. However, the company states that token holders will receive 30% of the company’s profits as a dividend. We are also not entirely clear on how often these dividends are paid out. Evidence suggests that it will either be quarterly or monthly. What’s also interesting is that the 30% dividend will be given out equally to all of the tokens that are held in the platform. This means that all tokens that are held outside of the Nexo platform will not qualify for the dividend, and thus their share will be distributed among tokens that are within the platform. NEXO tokens are currently trading for around $.10 each, with a market cap of just under $54 million. Nexo recently held a survey of their users on which ERC-20 asset they would most like to see supported. The winner by a wide margin was Binance BNB tokens. This means that from July 1 onwards, Binance tokens can be used in the same way as Ethereum and bitcoin on the platform. Meaning that it can be used as collateral on cash loans or as a repayment mechanism. While the two projects are not formally related, the Binance CEO tweeted about it shortly after to say thank you and express his appreciation for the support.  Binance tokens have exploded in recent months and the currency sits with a total market cap of just under $1.6 billion, or around $14 each in today’s market. The tokens are used to pay for various fees on the Binance platform and get discounts on trading fees among other features. Ever since Salt Lending announced their idea (and since seem to have mostly fizzled out) a number of players entering the space and are now competing for what could be a multi billion dollar market of crypto-backed cash loans. For example, Celsius Network, which plans to launch sometime this year, will offer many similar functions as Nexo but with a slightly different arrangement of features. For instance, Celsius requires that you own tokens in order to get loans but does not require you to use them to repay loans in order to get a good interest rate. Further, instead of using a security token to issue dividends, Celsius will offer interest on deposited bitcoin and Ethereum. Up until now, Salt has not stated that they will offer any form of profit sharing, interest, or dividends to its users. It instead appears to be only for offering cash loans to a very small group of people that live in just a handful of US states that have qualified for lending. Even Ethlend, the Ethereum smart contract powered crypto-to-crypto lending platform wants to get into crypto to fiat loans and have announced their intentions to do so in the near future. Needless to say, consumers will soon have a lot of choices when it comes to where to get a crypto-backed cash loan.",

        "passage": "Next year Power Ledger will allow people to buy a share in a commercial solar power plant in Australia. According to Power Ledger co-founder and chairman Jemma Green, “That (their new program) will be the world’s first regulated crypto energy offering.” Building electrical infrastructure isn’t something that most people can invest in directly. The up-front cost to build large-scale generation facilities is well beyond the reach of most people, and there are also numerous regulations that prevent an individual from supporting new forms of greener power generation.  Power Ledger is working to change the way electrical power is created, and giving regular people a way to participate in the global energy game. Ms. Green explained that, “Presently, it’s quite hard for everyday people to invest in and co-own energy assets,” and continued, “It’s pretty much exclusively the domain of institutional investors.” The new project will allow investors to gain from the power that is sold into the grid, and potentially change how electrical infrastructure is financed in nations that allow this platform to be used. Power Ledger is working on numerous projects that all focus on next-generation energy technology. Over the last decade the price of renewable energy sources like solar and wind have fallen. Depending on the location, solar or wind power can be the cheapest source there is. Unlike conventional power sources, solar and wind power can be built at a scale that is much smaller than a coal, nuclear or natural gas facility. In theory this is a huge advantage, but in practice, it is challenging for everyone involved. Traditionally, power has been generated at one large facility and distributed to consumers. Small-scale solar generation flips this dynamic on its head. Today, a residential area can create most of the power it needs without a problem, but monetizing the electricity isn’t straightforward. Because electrical infrastructure was designed as a one-way street, getting paid for excess generation on a small scale is hard with the current systems. Power Ledger is taking a multi-faceted approach to the next generation of electrical infrastructure. Their new Asset Germination program will take existing power generation facilities and give retail investors the ability to buy a portion of their generating capacity. Later, they plan to expand their reach to new generation projects. Jemma Green explains that normally financing a large-scale energy project is a lengthy process. To wit, “It’s very time consuming, and there aren’t that many buyers, because it’s a large asset in terms of how it’s packaged,” she continues “But in fractionalizing it into some portions and putting that token on an exchange, that makes the asset more liquid.” Whatever asset is held via their new blockchain-based architecture would be structured legally as a trust, and managed by a custodian. Blockchain would record all the information, so that investors have a secure record of the energy produced, and money that is collected. The options that exist for electrical consumers have more-or-less been binary. A person can be on-the-grid, or choose to go it alone. In fact, in many countries, mid-scale power generation facilities have to be fed into the national grid on whatever terms the government dictates. Now small-scale solar installations are changing the game. Programs like Power Ledger’s Asset Germination have the potential to further break the back of the structural power monopoly that governments and the wealthy have held for more than a century. In addition to allowing small-scale solar generation to supplant the existing power generation model, Power Ledger is enabling smaller investors to enter the power generation market with no middlemen. The results of this shift will take time, but they could define the future of how infrastructure is built and owned.",

        "passage": "Coinbase has stunned the cryptocurrency world once again with a fresh announcement that the exchange has begun what they call exploratory research on adding five new assets. A few of those assets come as a surprise, while others seem to have been nearly a given for some time now given their general growth.  It’s important to note before we begin that Coinbase as stated in no uncertain terms that there are no guarantees that any of these assets will be added at all. Instead, the company stated that they will begin officially researching these assets and whether or not they can be added from both a technological perspective and a legal one. The lineup of assets currently undergoing investigation include Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Zcash, 0x, and Stellar Lumens. One asset that is notably absent, however, is the infamous Ripple XRP. When Coinbase announced recently that they would be including Ethereum Classic, the announcement was met with an outcry of frustrated investors that were expecting the next asset to be added would be XRP. This time is no different as XRP fans are once again expressing their fury and discontent. One user on Twitter even suggested that all XRP investors “delete Coinbase” as the exchange has not demonstrated any interest in adding their asset of choice.  And another disappointed XRP believer:  Another interesting point was a large number of Tweets asking for various other assets to be added in the future, with more than a dozen users asking for the exchange to consider adding DigiByte, and a handful of requests for assets like Verge. Zcash is unique among all assets being offered or considered by Coinbase as it does allow for completely anonymous transactions. Zcash transactions are not anonymous by default, but with the correct wallet, transactions can be made that are currently untraceable.  Read also: How to Mine ZCash Suggestions have been made that perhaps Coinbase will only accept deposits of Zcash that come from non-anonymized sources. Specifically, the post says: Further, the blog post announcing the exploration of the new assets stated that it is possible that not all assets will be available for trading in all areas, or even that some assets can only be bought and sold within the platform, but withdrawals and deposits would not be allowed. Currently, Coinbase has not made any statements detailing exactly how this would work as we are still in the early stages. The blog post also included a section providing some additional information about the upcoming launch of Ethereum Classic trading support. The article stated that Ethereum classic is already a confirmed asset and will be made available once it is ready. Unlike these five assets announced today that are only in an exploratory phase, Ethereum classic does not require as much work as it is technically virtually identical to Ethereum, and asset that the exchange is supported for quite some time now. The Medium post in question states: Following the announcement from Coinbase, all five of the assets that are being explored by Coinbase saw sharp price jumps, with some jumping as much as 25% after the announcement.  It is conceivable that we will see more general upward movement like Ethereum Classic has had since its announcement. However it is still entirely possible that some or even all of these assets will not end up being added to Coinbase, or may only be added in a highly simplified manner. We suspect that in the coming days, the price jump that we saw today will slowly even out and will only appear again once Coinbase officially confirms which assets are being included.",

        "passage": "Crypto-related crime has struck again; this time in Jaipur, India, but thankfully the long arm of the law caught up with the perpetrators before they could do much damage. Indian police have reportedly uncovered the den of kidnappers who had held two Bitcoin traders captive for two weeks. Per the report, the two Bitcoin traders, Luftan Shaikh, and Mohammad Shazad had been kidnapped alongside and another individual named Malang Shah.  According to the Indian Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikas Sharma, the gang of seven had been demanding 80 bitcoins (about 8 crores and $848,720 at current market price) from the family of the traders. “The gang kidnapped Shaikh and Shazad, two bitcoin traders, and demanded 80 bitcoins worth ₹8 crore. Shah was kidnapped two days later. The gang demanded ₹10 lakh from his family members,” said Sharma. Sharma revealed that the gang’s nefarious activities were first suspected when a man in the neighborhood was found loitering with a pistol at around 2:30 am on Sunday. After apprehension and questioning, the criminal the police to the rest of his team, who had been torturing the captured trio on the ninth floor of an 11-story building. The gang is suspected to be connected to some other crimes including various kidnappings, robbery, extortion, and loot cases. While it is impressive that the Indian police caught up with this set of criminals and rescued the captives, this case is one victory in a sea of vanquished crypto-related ransom cases. Other reported kidnaps that requested for the ransom to be paid in cryptocurrency ended in less than happy notes. For as long as cryptocurrency has been deemed valuable, kidnappers and other criminals have taken a sick affinity to the coin. This does not come as a surprise, mainly because cryptocurrency transactions offer a degree of anonymity that sufficiently covers the criminal’s tracks, but thankfully, not all the time. Even crypto’s anonymity cannot cover up for criminals with slow brains- as is often the case. In September 2018, Costa Rican news outlets reported the kidnap of American businessman William Sean Creighton, and the subsequent demand for a $5 million ransom paid in cryptocurrency. Creighton’s family could only pay $1 million,  and wait for the return of their relative. Sadly, Creighton was never released- and is still declared missing till now, and is presumed dead. The kidnappers were apprehended, as their IP address was flagged after they tried to convert the crypto funds to fiat. Anonymity could only see them so far– but sadly Creighton could not be rescued. Last year also, Norwegian Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen was abducted outside her home in Oslo. Elisabeth was wife to one of Norway’s richest men, Tom Hagen, so the kidnappers must have deemed it fit to ask for the $10 million ransom that they did, to be paid in cryptocurrency. Hagen paid the ransom, but his wife was never released. In fact, subsequent reports are speculating that she may never be released, and was possibly murdered. It is hard to say. Anonymity is one of the most distinguishing attributes of cryptocurrency, and if that is lost, crypto might as well cease to exist. However, the fact that crypto is crime-plagued does not make it any more of a dark tool than fiat. Fiat is also used for heinous crimes all over the world, and it does not even need anonymity to do it. While this is not an explanation that washes cryptocurrency of the mud that criminals have rolled it in, it does suffice to keep the pot from calling the kettle black.",

        "passage": "Chainlink (LINK), the decentralized oracle middleware project that helps smart contracts interact with real-world data, has been among the best performing crypto projects so far in 2019. Of course, bitcoin (BTC) has been the one leading the cryptoeconomy up as of late, being up 11 percent on the week, up 18 percent on the month, and up 73 percent over the last three months. Yet LINK has been putting up similarly optimistic numbers — the crypto’s price is up 43 percent on the week, up 29 percent on the month, and up 54 percent over the last three months in kind.  The crypto, which now enjoys enjoys a market capitalization of approximately $240 million USD, is currently priced at $0.068 — now more than halfway to its all-time price high of $1.28, which was reached during the peak of the cryptoeconomy’s last bull run in January 2018. As the crypto ecosystem has seemingly started to turn bullish once more, many of the top coins’ prices have started to show new signs of life in the market. But LINK, a lesser known project generally speaking, has been one of the better performers recently — why? The answer to that question is undoubtedly a combination of things. First, Chainlink is tackling decentralized oracles, which could end up taking smart contract tech to the mainstream. It’s also the largest and most reputable project working on oracles, with Chainlink’s technical maestro Sergey Nazarov being a respected mind in the ecosystem. A factor surely at play is Chainlink’s small, underdog status. Traders have likely looked at LINK as a coin that can grow higher and faster than top 10 crypto projects that have already become well established. Thus, Chainlink could provide a more aggressive bet than other coins at present. Another dynamic to consider is that the Chainlink team has been quietly racking up partnerships around the space. Decrypt recently profiled these partnerships, of which there are now approximately 30. Chainlink’s latest partnership announcement came on May 9th, as the team and the builders of the Hedera Hashgraph decentralized ledger declared they had inked a deal. Specifically, the agreement will entail Chainlink helping to implement its oracle network into the enterprise-minded Hedera Hashgraph ledger. As such, those writing Hashgraph smart contracts will be able to leverage Chainlink’s oracles in the future.  Read: What is Hedera Hashgraph? Jordan Fried — Hedera’s SVP of Global Business Development — hailed the collaboration as an advancement for the possibilities of smart contracts in general: The Hedera team also noted that the team-up would give Chainlink’s tech exposure to some of the “largest global enterprises” operating today. The debate is still on as to whether the cryptoeconomy has entered a full-fledged bull market cycle. If it has, though, Chainlink seems like the kind of coin worth keeping an eye on. Chris Burniske, a partner at the venture capital firm Placeholder, recently outlined how bitcoin seems to rally first, at which point traders disseminate their profits into altcoins that are viewed as “depressed” — i.e. undervalued.  In his associated Twitter thread, Burniske didn’t mention any specific altcoin by name — “pick your alt,” he said. Yet the possible tinderbox conditions around Chainlink seems to make it precisely the kind of “depressed” altcoin that could help lead the cryptoeconomy’s next altcoin cycle if the bitcoin price continues to push up. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, and it’s impossible to say what will happen next in these markets. But in the very least, it’s clear Chainlink is an interesting project to watch going forward.",

        "passage": "Most bitcoin naysayers come from the world of traditional finance – banks, venture capital, and so on. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has now joined them with the claim that bitcoin is like Napster, a necessary and transformative failure. Naturally, he thinks his company’s XRP coin is superior, but is he right, or is he just pumping his own cryptocurrency?  Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO. Image from Coinstaker.com When Napster was created, it was not initially intended to be a business. Instead, it was a tool that would eventually give birth to the various peer-to-peer and filesharing networks that are omnipresent today. For those that don’t remember or were too young to experience it, Napster was a piece of software that allowed anyone to share and download MP3 files, regardless of copyright. This allowed for the instant and free distribution of copyrighted music to anyone and everyone in the world in a largely anonymous way.  Napster as it looked in 2001, Image from Archive.org Napster did not operate forever, however, and was eventually shut down due to pressure from the music industry. The legacy of Napster still lives on as consumer’s relations with the music industry have shifted significantly, and the expectation of needing to buy a $20 CD in order to get music are now effectively gone forever. For a brief time Napster was brought back as a legally compliant paid music service, but it died quickly. This is what Ripple CEO Garlinghouse thinks of bitcoin. That while the technology is essential and transformative, it will eventually die due to failing to be “engaged with regulators to solve a real problem” According to Garlinghouse, Ripple’s XRP is not only superior to bitcoin due to its supposed compliance with regulators (despite being sued for securities fraud earlier this year), but that it is also somehow financially or technologically superior. Garlinghouse cites the classic example of buying coffee with bitcoin. According to him, bitcoin transactions take 20 minutes to complete, and the transaction fee would double the cost of buying coffee. Clearly, Garlinghouse is not familiar with SegWit and Lightning Network. Both of these technologies allow for significantly cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions. Additionally, while a bitcoin transaction could take several minutes to confirm, that does not mean it takes 20 minutes to appear on the blockchain and be a reliable indicator of funds sent. During a speech given at MIT, famed bitcoin commentator Andreas Antonopoulos spoke on the true nature of bitcoin confirmations, saying: In other words, stores could very reasonably sell someone a cup of coffee at zero confirmations. That means just a few seconds is all that’s needed, not “20 minutes”. Things get even more impressive when Lightning Network is involved. Specifically when using the technology, transactions complete in just a few seconds and cost less than a penny. Let’s compare the usefulness of Ripple’s XRP coin compared to bitcoin. Today, bitcoin can be used directly to make myriad of different sorts of purchases. Bitcoin can even be used to directly purchase gold and silver. Bitcoin is by far the most commonly accepted cryptocurrency around the world, and also the most available in terms of exchange support, online purchase with fiat currency, and with the sheer number of compatible ATM devices worldwide.  Ripple, Worth the Hype ? Now let’s look at Ripple. Its XRP coin which was primarily created to facilitate bank-to-bank payments has so far never been used by a single bank, ever. The number of stores or businesses that accept Ripple as a payment is trivial compared to bitcoin, and the same can be said for the number of exchanges like Coinbase that would sell it directly for fiat currency. Further, only a small handful of ATM devices sell Ripple directly. Just in terms of adoption, bitcoin is light-years ahead of Ripple. Further, the primary goal of Ripple’s XRP coin, to be used by banks, has still never happened and no bank has announced even a tiny degree of intent or interest to use XRP for anything whatsoever. Ripple has only managed to sell other technologies they have created and that are unrelated to cryptocurrency. Back in January the company said they were doing a trial with MoneyGram (not a bank) but the public has yet to hear whether or not this led to a real world partnership. Another significant point to mention about Ripple and its XRP coin is that it is completely dominated by the Ripple company itself. Ripple the company and its employees and advisers are sitting on billions of XRP coins. Ripple is a centralized company, with a centralized network, and a largely centralized blockchain. Compare this to bitcoin. No individual company controls bitcoin or its issuance. It’s network is much more decentralized than Ripple’s, and bitcoin transactions are mined and processed all over the globe. Because of the wide support of miners, bitcoin is also arguably the most secure cryptocurrency on earth. The most important point here is that while there are billions of XRP coins locked up and waiting to flood the market, bitcoin is under no such artificial controls or restrictions. One of the main points of cryptocurrency is that there should be no central authority manipulating the supply. With Ripple and its XRP coins, there is a central authority, and they have almost unlimited power in terms of their potential for manipulating the supply of bitcoin on the market. Ripple and its XRP coin may appear to be very promising to a number of investors. However, we must remember that XRP coins simply aren’t being used for much of anything besides investor speculation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is already out there every day processing real-world transactions and payments. The technology still has a long way to go in order to continue scaling, but this is happening with each passing day. The XRP coin, on the other hand, is the Ripple corporations attempt to put a suit and tie on cryptocurrency. But so far, no major bank seems interested. And so, when Ripple CEO Garlinghouse says that Ripple is in every way superior, we would ask that he not just make wild claims, but instead prove them.",

        "passage": "Venezuela is rapidly becoming an exemplar of a socioeconomic basket case. More than a decade of wildly ineffective government policies have left the once prosperous nation in dire straits. CoinCola, a leading crypto exchange, recently announced they would be taking steps to help Venezuelans escape from a broken monetary system with discounted transaction fees and referral rewards on their platform until the end of October. CoinCola is also adding Dash to their OTC trading platform. Dash has rapidly become a favorite crypto for people in Latin America. CoinCola users will now be able to use their local fiat currency (e.g. bolivar, pesos or euros) to buy and sell Dash.  Dash Core Group CEO Ryan Taylor commented on the new partnership via a press release, The Venezuelan government has destroyed a vibrant economy. Today the average Venezuelan has literally no access to basic social services like health care and police protection. Needless to say, in such a dystopian situation, the Venezuelan monetary system shattered many years ago. In an effort to stem the depreciation on the Venezuelan Bolivar, President Maduro announced recently that the Bolivar would be devalued by 95%+, and pegged to the Petro. Unfortunately for the Venezuelan people, the Petro is likely just another sham. Instead of being backed by hard goods, the Petro is backed by Venezuelan oil reserves, which are essentially worthless under the present circumstances. The dire state of just about everything in Venezuela is probably part of the reason why cryptocurrency use is on the rise. When compared to their domestic currency options, the fluctuations in crypto prices look very tame. Cryptos are also out of the government’s reach, which is a huge benefit to a population that is being antagonized by a seemingly power-mad quasi-dictator. While many think that China has been successful in kicking crypto out of the Middle Kingdom, according to CoinCola Founder and CEO Allan Zhang, “ CoinCola is averaging 100,000 transactions every month on our platform. We are the second largest public OTC platform in the world by transaction volume and at this time 95 percent of total transactions are from Asia.” CoinCola is dedicated to expanding their demographics beyond Asia. Mr. Zhang described the motivations behind his company’s recent expansion, “With our partnership with Dash, we will be truly global. We decided to partner with Dash because it is the most efficient digital currency for payments, offers lowest fees, and provides InstantSend technology. Dash represents a strong presence in Venezuela, Latin America, and the rest of the world. We are very selective in with which coins we list to our platform and we are proud to now offer Dash to Venezuelan users.” It is possible that in the future, governments will have to contend with a new decentralized financial system that limits their options to abuse the trust of their population. In the absence of a reliable form of money, it is almost impossible to create a functioning, modern economy. CoinCola looks like they are on the leading edge of offering economically marginalized new opportunities. To help the population of Venezuela, and Latin America, gain access to their platform, they will be launching a new version of their app that features a Spanish interface.",

According to Roger Ver, who goes by the username – MemoryDealers on Reddit,  one of the most vocal supporters of Bitcoin Cash and founder of Bitcoin.com, anonymous government-backed hackers were attempting to compromise one of the Bitcoin.com’s email accounts.  Ver received a Google Suite alert about a potential intrusion into one of his emails on Feb. 28. “Because Bitcoin.com is building tools to bring economic freedom to the world, we are likely under government-backed attacks,” he wrote alongside the screenshot of the alert on Reddit. Google Suite accounts began receiving alerts about government-sponsored cyber attacks back in 2017 after Google updated its security protocols. The service is able to identify malware-loaded emails, phishing attempts, or brute force attacks carried out from government-linked cyber espionage associations, known as Advanced Persistent Threats. According to Google, if such an attack is successful, it could lead attackers to all of Bitcoin.com’s data at once. This may include emails, docs, spreadsheets, sites, presentations, and cloud-enabled file backups. Eric Grosse, the vice president of security engineering at Google, said that seeing an alert about a government-sponsored attack doesn’t mean that hackers have managed to gain access to the website or any of the users’ accounts. However, it means that the website and the associated accounts are a target and that they must take steps to improve their security. Despite the fact that Google doesn’t reveal their criteria for what constitutes a “government-backed attack,” many crypto enthusiasts have seconded Ver about the possibilities of a big government such as China being behind the attack. A Reddit user pointed out that Google has a very weak track record when it comes to “calling out the U.S. government,” which could mean that there was another government involved. It still remains unclear who attacked Bitcoin.com – it could take several weeks, or even months before the public sees a new development in the case. What remains certain is the fact that crypto businesses and websites have become the go-to target for cybercriminals in the past few years.",

        "passage": "The Ethereum Classic Cooperative (ETC Cooperative for short) has just released their latest biannual report on their progress to help Ethereum Classic grow and become a top choice for DApp producers. In the report, the group states that they currently have a surplus supply of cash and they are actively using it to draw attention to the project via sponsorships and by hiring developers to make improvements among other things. Their social media following has more than doubled, and daily transaction rates are soaring.   Much like the classic state of the union address given by the US president, the ETC Cooperative releases a report every six-months detailing their successes, failures, and their plans for the future. Ethereum Classic has been a hot topic in cryptocurrency for the last few weeks following the announcement that Coinbase would be listing the asset in the near future. The ETC Cooperative is, in many ways, analogous to the Ethereum Foundation headed by notable individuals like Vitalik Buterin. Led by Anthony Lusardi, the cooperative is in the process of becoming a US nonprofit organization that will potentially allow them to receive tax-deductible donations in the near future if successful with the filing.  According to the report, the group has an annual positive cash flow of $375,000, and is currently sitting on a USD cash reserve of $700,000. Most of the report is dedicated to what the team has done, what they are doing, and areas where they feel they need to develop. It also details how they are spending their budget including donations they have received. Let’s go over some of those points now. The goal of the cooperative is to support the ETC “community, development, and marketing efforts within the Ethereum Classic ecosystem” with the intention of making it better by “removing pain points and obstacles that interfere with ETC’s current and future users”. With that in mind, the group notes that their social media following has grown significantly, with their sub Reddit and Twitter accounts seeing increases of up to 70%. The blockchain itself has seen a 175% increase in average transactions per day, or about 47,000 every 24 hours. For some context, Ethereum sees about 10 times that amount each day.  Read also: Beginners Guide to Ethereum Vs. Ethereum Classic Stated also in the report is a list of enhancements that the group is made to the technology behind the blockchain. Specifically, there’s been a lot of development on the etherhub.io site, improvements have been made to boot nodes, and a system has been developed that will help major stakeholders get alerts on when critical updates come out. The team has also revamped their primary website, EthereumClassic.org and launched a new site EthereumClassicAsia.org that is designed to specifically provide native language information for China, Japan, and South Korea. The report also mentions a number of areas with the project that are “undermaintained”. Those include the lack of multiple block explorers, coordinating updates with miners and exchanges was not smooth, the primary website was outdated until recently, a number of language groups were “underserved”, and perhaps most importantly, “ETC was largely seen as separate to the broader Ethereum community”. Perhaps it is this last one that is the most poignant. Indeed if Ethereum Classic is able to get in touch with the existing Ethereum community, such as developers and entrepreneurs, it could be easier for them to encourage more projects to make use of it as it does offer a number of financial and technological benefits over Ethereum due in part to the fact that the chain is in some ways underutilized when it comes to decentralized applications. One major advantage Ethereum Classic has is that any code that is written for Ethereum can function exactly the same within Ethereum Classic, and so developers who already have skills with Ethereum development already have this necessary skills to write software or contracts for ETC. The report then details the six primary goals that the group will be focusing on for its next six-month timeline. Those goals include completing in-progress programs, increasing outreach and marketing attempts, getting better in touch with different language groups, developing a working relationship with a number of industries that could benefit from using ETC, building closer ties between the different ETC teams, and hiring more staff to support additional projects. In other words, if you’re looking for a job in the blockchain space, you might want to take a look at the ETC Cooperative. The report closes by mentioning that the group received a “very generous donation” from Digital Finance Group and Grayscale, an investment company that operates the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust. The group has a goal of receiving $1.75 million in donations for the year, of which they claim to have already received half. Ethereum Classic has come a long way since it first came into existence. It’s gone from something that was worth just a few pennies each, to something that is becoming somewhat of a star child for many in the cryptocurrency world. But it’s not all sunshine and roses, however, as Ethereum Classic still has a long way to go if it’s ever going to catch up with its much bigger cousin. By all accounts, it appears that the goal of the ETC Cooperative is not to defeat or unseat Ethereum, but instead to find its own unique space in the ever-growing blockchain industry.",

        "passage": "The long-awaited Trump Bitcoin tweet has materialized, and it came in the form of a scathing, if not draconian, rebuke against the cryptoeconomy. On July 11th, President Trump tweeted out a late evening thread in which he lambasted cryptocurrencies, calling Bitcoin and its peers “highly volatile and based on thin air” and prone to facilitating illegal activities.  Naturally, his comments caused an immediate explosion of responses on social media, mostly from cryptocurrency proponents defiantly poking back.  In the second of a trio of tweets, the president added that Facebook’s coming Libra basketcoin would have “little standing or dependability,” being only the latest influential global authority to publicly air major concerns with the social media giant’s coming cryptocurrency. “If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks,” President Trump said. In the last of the thread’s posts, the president played up the strength and centrality of the dollar, saying there is “only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, dependable and reliable.” How’s that for a shot across the bow!  The tweets come after many in the cryptoverse have been angling for months to meme a Trump Bitcoin comment into existence. However, the President’s Thursday remarks surely aren’t as agreeable as the comments such influencers had in mind. The main question seems to be why now? One possible answer is that the president had become aware of comments that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had made earlier in the day, wherein Powell had expressed reservations about the Libra and notably characterized bitcoin as a “speculative store of value like gold.” President Trump has proven to be a potent and vocal critic of Powell’s monetary policies in recent months, so it’s clear he tracks the Chairman’s activities closely. Powell’s aforementioned cryptocurrency comments came before the Senate Banking Committee on Friday, so one can assume Trump saw news of the testimony as the day progressed and learned of Bitcoin — possibly for the first time.  Interestingly, during his congressional testimony Chairman Powell — who heads up the central banking system of the U.S. — likened Bitcoin as akin to a digital form of gold: That assertion may not have sat well with President Trump, who has been going to bat for the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, arguing for Chairman Powell to use inflation to more aggressively compete with foreign currencies like the euro and the yuan.  It’s clear the president has money on his mind, and now it’s clearer yet that he thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t money at all. But cryptoeconomy stakeholders will say that President Trump simply has an outdated understanding of the concept. Even Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has previously argued before the highest court in the land that “perhaps one day employees will be paid in Bitcoin or some other type of cryptocurrency.” President Trump’s recent calls for the Fed to keep interest rates low and to undertake quantitative easing (QE) highlight some of the main selling points of bitcoin: it’s deflationary in perpetuity and immune to the economic or political whims of a single and temporary administration. And with major countries like China and Russia looking to de-dollarize amid an atmosphere of political distrust, there’s an opening for non-sovereign currencies like bitcoin to make inroads as a reserve currency that isn’t controlled by any lone country.",

        "passage": "The cryptoeconomy’s vanguard cryptocurrency just saw its highest valuation yet in 2019. On April 1st, the bitcoin (BTC) price consolidated over the $4,000 USD mark as buy pressure pushed the OG crypto past $4,100 and then up towards $5,000 for a time in the early hours of April 2nd.  The sharp uptrend, underpinned by $10 billion in trade volume on the day, comes as the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s top assets have been relatively non-volatile in recent weeks, with BTC markets in particular having been sideways since December 2018.  Bitcoin’s price may still be down more than 70 percent from its all-time high of just over $20,000 USD in late 2017, but the coin’s sudden acute surge combined with recently improving sentiments in the space will undoubtedly stoke speculation that the bearish crypto market cycle that began last January is waning. Where BTC’s valuation goes from here in the short-term remains to be seen, though mid-term optimism in the cryptoverse could grow if traders take bitcoin’s latest move as a sign of what’s to come in 2019. That will all surely hinge on if bitcoin can maintain support above $4,000 in the interim. An interesting correlation with the fresh bitcoin price rise has been a spike in BTC transactions over the past few days.  Blockchain co-founder and CEO Peter Smith on his Twitter, where he highlighted that April 1st saw Bitcoin’s mempool exceed more than 51,000 transactions — an amount that marked an activity increase of approximately 3,300 percent in just one week. Why there’s been such a sudden flurry of transactions is an open question for now. One possible contributing factor could be that the bitcoin price’s recent consolidation over $4,000 has simply brought more traders back to their portfolios. Visa may currently offer considerably higher throughput-per-second capabilities than Bitcoin, but both payments networks approach the concept of money in drastically different ways, and that’s an important dynamic to consider whenever attempting to valuate BTC. Of course, it’s worth mentioning that both networks are constantly evolving — sometimes steadily and sometimes in sudden leaps — and that the competition between them is a fluid, if not asymmetrical, one. With that said, Bitcoin hasn’t done bad for itself in that competition if the project’s transaction volume in 2018 is any indication.  According to a new report from cryptocurrency data analytics firm DataLight, the average bitcoin transaction amount in 2018 was $41,615 — many orders of magnitude higher than Visa’s average transaction size of $90 in the same span. The company’s researchers said: The Bitcoin network’s large transaction size average indicates it’s popular “for larger, probably international payments,” per DataLight. Notably, the network’s $3.4 trillion in total transaction volume last year put the cryptocurrency within relative striking distance of the $11.2 trillion worth of transactions that Visa then facilitated. There’s room for growth yet if Ikigai Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Travis Kling’s new Bitcoin “insurance policy” op-ed offers any clues. Thererin, Kling perceptively noted: And with the possibility of getting annualized investment returns going forward via second-layer Lightning Network nodes, the long-term future of bitcoin seems safely aimed toward further maturation.  Things are still very early on, in any case. And that dynamic is simultaneously a downside and a blessing for the genesis crypto.",

        "passage": "Singapore is charging ahead as one of the most forward-thinking blockchain development zones on the planet. A recent survey from PwC found that respondents in Singapore had the highest level of trust in blockchain, at 37%. The city-state also has seen a massive influx of blockchain-focused investment capital this year, and a very supportive stance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) helps everyone there. All that development money is flowing into hundreds of companies that are developing unique solutions that potentially have commercial viability. Most blockchain start-ups have to limit themselves to a narrow use-case scenario, due to the high cost of development.  There is still a lot that people don’t understand about blockchain, and there have been numerous attacks launched against the technology. Despite the fact that there are probably many ideas that won’t make it to the marketplace, blockchain development is yielding some great new platforms. Lots of R&D spending and some dead ends is totally normal for a new technology, and will likely lead to incredible new tools for a range of industries. The initial reaction from the mainstream financial community last year to blockchain and cryptocurrencies wasn’t very supportive. There is still some bad information out there, especially as it concerns the viability of blockchain as a technology. Sankalp Shangari is the CEO of LALA World, which is based in Singapore. He recently told Entrepreneur that, LALA World is developing LALA ID, which is a blockchain-based solution for keeping personal information safe in an increasingly connected digital world. As numerous recent data breaches demonstrate, the need for online privacy is very real. Mr. Shangari added that, “The world is going gung-ho about the possibilities of the said technology, which is gradually growing as an infrastructural pillar of economic functionalities, receiving the attention it deserves.” One of the biggest advantages that Singapore has in the blockchain development space is the connectivity that a densely packed, highly-educated workforce creates. Singapore Power Group (SPG) just launched a blockchain-based market that facilitates trade in renewable energy certificates (RECs). Commercial entities in Singapore can buy RECs, and renewable energy will be produced. The blockchain platform that SPG designed themselves will directly match sellers and buyers automatically. Samuel Tan, the chief digital officer at Singapore Power said that, “Through blockchain technology, we enable companies to trade in renewable energy certificates conveniently, seamlessly and securely, helping them achieve greener business operations and meet their sustainability targets.” Quadrant Protocol is another Singapore-based blockchain-focused company that is taking advantage of what Singapore has to offer the industry. They are working on how to make sure Artificial Intelligence algos have the best information possible, and the company sees blockchain as a great tool for the job. According to founder Mike Davie, As these ideas and platforms develop, there will almost certainly be overlaps that can create even greater levels of efficiency. Singapore is probably one of the best locations in the world for blockchain technology, and the companies that excel there will be well placed globally to grow into a market that is just starting to be understood by the public-at-large.",

        "passage": "Despite the market’s up and downs, it would be foolish to dismiss Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cryptocurrencies in general. Regardless of asset prices or SEC regulation, the underlying blockchain technology is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. According to Stephen Palley, a blockchain attorney with Anderson Kill, that will always be the case even if the prices stay down.  On top of this, Palley claims that the recent SEC regulation changes do not affect the recent market crash. This assertion goes against analyst declarations, but it isn’t a baseless claim. “I’m not sure that there is necessarily any connection between recent SEC activity and the price of cryptocurrencies. It’s difficult for me to see a causal relationship,” said Palley in an interview with Bloomberg TV. The lawyer continued, stating that crypto is a global market. Digital assets aren’t only reliant on the United States, and securities laws differ across the world. SEC regulations do not inherently affect the whole world of crypto. Palley is bullish on the future of crypto as well. “I would not write off bitcoin, and I would not write off Ethereum. These are very interesting technologies.” It’s safe to say that he truly believes this too, as his career is reliant on the success of the crypto space. That, and he thinks we should think longer term about the market. The current, smaller-scale ups and downs will have little to do with crypto’s long-term success. Recently, the SEC went after and took down two cryptocurrency startups for hosting illegal ICOs. The two companies in question, Paragon and AirFox, were required to pay $350,000 in fines. They also had to refund any investors that put money into the ICO. Paragon had to pay $12 million and AirFox $15 million. It is somewhat believed that the SEC was after the crypto space due to these takedowns. Palley was asked about these claims, though he thinks little of them: The SEC has taken down multiple different crypto startups. In every case, the government agency has had good reasons for doing so. Assuming the shutdowns are “attacks” on the community is a tad rash. Also, Palley calls out the crypto community for some of its actions. Just because securities laws aren’t up to snuff, that doesn’t mean they don’t apply to crypto. This is a new technology, and it must adhere to the laws established. If there was some message from the SEC, Palley believes it would be “we told you. Follow the law. Palley also claims that the SEC movements have no bearing on ICO interest. He even recently received a call from someone in Europe regarding a new ICO: Companies that think they can use ICOs to raise money and then not abide by these laws are wrong says, Palley. Those groups deserve to be taken down for not following the rules. The lawyer’s crypto predictions are similar to that of Tom Lee from Fundstrat. Lee still believes Bitcoin will hit $15,000 this year:",

        "passage": "Hackers have reportedly stolen nearly $10 million worth of Ripple (XRP) from about 100 XRP ledger wallets on GateHub, as reported in a preliminary statement issued by the CEO of crypto wallet service provider, Enej Pungercar, on June 6. Gatehub disclosed, in the statement, that they were notified by customers whose wallets were compromised. Estimated count of all affected users was about 100, but the platform has stated that it has not been confirmed that all the affected XRP wallets were hosted on GateHub.  At first, the company couldn’t point its finger towards any nefarious activity on the platform but when it dug deeper, it formed a hypothesis of possible ways the attackers got access to the encrypted keys. It wasn’t through brute force or suspicious logins. The company stated that they discovered an increase in application programming interface (API) calls coming from a small number of IP addresses. Gatehub is reportedly still working with law enforcement and other security professionals to figure out what happened and whether their system remains at risk. The firm hopes to get things back to normal soon. Gatehub community member, Thomas Silkjær, who reportedly warned the platform about a possible breach, published a report  about the hack, stating that: Silkjær also disclosed that approximately 23,200,000 XRP had been stolen from 80–90 victims, of which 13,100,000 XRP have been laundered through exchanges and mixer services, as at the time that the report was published. To prevent further breaches, Gatehub has disabled all access tokens on June 1st after the suspicious API calls were stopped. However, the question on the minds of the cryptocurrency owners at large is whether the platform will regain the trust that their users invested in them and their platform, as breaches like this may be hard to recover from. Now that users have been urged to suspend activities on  their GateHub XRP wallets, subscriber numbers will definitely take a plunge, and many may resort to alternative web wallet services. While it is admirable that the management decided to be transparent with their information sources, it does not speak well of Gatehub’s administration and security that the users noticed the breach before they did, so that may not work in their favor as well. With this incident, 2019 seems to be quickly gaining ground as the year of crypto hacks. Increasing reports of hacks and breaches are circulating, and while it may be an indicator of the growth in the cryptocurrency sector in more countries, it is also a signal that security on exchange platforms and wallet providers needs to step up. Plus, for new crypto investors, picking a platform to get a web wallet could become a problem. One wallet provider who won’t lose sleep thinking about hackers is Komodo. The crypto wallet provider successfully hacked its own customers, following notification of a potential breach that could have resulted in the theft of funds worth nearly $13 million, broken down to 8 million komodo (KMD) tokens and 96 bitcoin.",

        "passage": "Would you believe it if someone told you that you could turn $1000 into $3650 in one year, every year, absolutely guaranteed? What about turning $10,000 into $36,500? Odds are likely you would be suspicious of such claims given that a typical well performing Wall Street investment would average out to about 4% per year. But in the world of Ponzi schemes and HYIP scams, these kinds of promises are the norm. So join us as we dig into an apparent Ponzi scheme that’s promising 1% per day every day, for life.  If you’re not familiar with the term, a Ponzi scheme is a kind of scam investment in which potential investors (victims) are tricked into getting involved and typically lose all their invested capital. These scams promise incredibly high rates of return, daily payouts, and guaranteed profits. Ponzi schemes have been around for a long time, but unfortunately they found a new home and a new batch of fresh victims in cryptocurrency. The most infamous of these crypto Ponzi schemes was of course BitConnect which crashed and burned not long ago, taking untold millions of dollars of investors money with it. But even with the widely discussed BitConnect hitting headlines everywhere, it seems that scammers are still out in force and new schemes are popping up all the time.  Bitconnect Scam The other day we came across another apparent scam, this one claiming it makes its money through real estate and offering guaranteed profits with no risk. The site we’re looking at today is WestLand Storage (westlandstorage.com). This site claims that it is a real estate investment platform in which investors can purchase individual square feet of real estate which is then supposedly rented or leased out. The profits from doing this are then returned to the investor at a rate of 1% per day. The company claims that this profit is absolutely guaranteed, and that there is no risk of any kind of loss whatsoever. If your mental alarm bells aren’t going off already, they should be. The company claims to have been around for 17 years, and says that they have a worldwide network of real estate which is up for tokenization and investment. To identify a Ponzi scheme, you usually only need to find two things. The first is an offering of a ridiculous and unsustainable payout rate, and the second is a claim that these earnings are guaranteed and risk-free. On the site, we found both of those.  Unsustainable high-yields, Image from westlandstorage.com  Guaranteed profits, image from westlandstorage.com According to this fantasy, renting out real estate can yield an investor 1% of their total investment per day. Now let’s imagine how that would work in the real world. Suppose that you were to rent a residential property. Would you expect to pay 1% of the total value of the real estate you are renting, every single day? Let’s do a simple example. Let’s say that you’re renting a small single-family residential home in rural America. The total value of that home is $250,000. If what WestLand storage was promising were true and accurately reflected the real estate market, then you would expect to pay 1% per day to rent this home. That means your rent would be $2500 a day. Going further, that would mean to rent your home, it would cost $75,000 a month. At that price, you might as well buy the home as you’re going to end up paying its entire price after just a few months. In the real world (and not the Ponzi scheme fantasy world) you could reasonably expect to pay anywhere from $1000-$2000 a month to rent a small residential home outside of a big city in the US. That’s per month, mind you, not per day. Another major indicator of a scam of this sort is the general low effort and total lack of quality control visible in the site’s design. Most often, this manifests itself in the form of numerous spelling and grammar errors all over the site, as well as the near exclusive use of stock images. We found a number of major spelling and grammar errors on the site such as this one:  How musch, indeed!   And this grammar mistake:  While many blockchain projects come from non-native English speaking countries, if these projects are serious about appearing professional they will likely hire someone to edit or spell check their white paper or website. These types of Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, typically only exist for 3 to 6 months, or at most one year, before they collapse. As such, these scam site operators simply do not care to put in the effort to make sure their spelling and grammar are correct. Typically, these sorts of scams will spread through word-of-mouth via affiliate marketing links. For this particular site, they seem to have paid a number of smaller crypto news websites to place an identical paid press release (which is also written quite poorly) on each one. The exact same press release is linked on 9 other websites from westlandstorage.com, and dozens more can be found via a search. This includes a few sites which appear to have provided a translation for the press release. You can tell because they all contain the name “Mark Zuckerberg”. The press release ends with an alleged quote from someone named James Griffin of Today Real Estate Analyst Company. A quick search revealed only links to the various copies of this press release.  Search results for “Today Real Estate Analyst Company” Typically when a crypto news website directly posts a press release they will include a statement indicating that the release was provided by an outside third party, and that the site does not in any way endorse or approve of the content within. For example on bitcoinist.com, such a statement is included with the WestLand Storage PR piece. It’s safe to say that this particular scam decided to have these paid press releases placed on a number of websites in order to give them an air of legitimacy. However, they have not received any actual endorsement from these sites that wasn’t paid for. It’s unfortunate that cryptocurrency seems to inevitably attract all sorts of different kinds of scams and schemes. That’s why it’s important to always keep your investment expectations realistic. And if anyone starts promising guaranteed returns or 1% daily or more, turn around and walk away.",

        "passage": "Wikileaks has called for a global embargo on Coinbase after the platform terminated @Wikileaks’ account. In a move reminiscent of previous corporate and regulatory reaction and influence surrounding the Wikileaks phenomenon, the Coinbase exchange has written to the Wikileaks shop advising them of the closure of its account.  The Wikileaks shop claims that the suspension came without notice or prior indications of anything amiss. The shop employs the Coinbase exchange for its cryptocurrency transactions. Now, Wikileaks is branding Coinbase “as an unfit member of the crypto community,” and calling for all parties to desert the platform, based on its unseemly, authoritarian behavior. Wikileaks said on April 20, 2018, that “Coinbase has blocked the official @Wikileaks shop from its platform without notice or explanation.” Trading in apparel, phone accessories, books, posters and stickers, the online store also recently started offering Cryptokitties as part of its lineup.  Clearly flabbergasted by what has transpired, the Wikileaks shop also made part of the letter they received public in a bid to support their assertion that the suspension was unethical and a result of malicious targeting of Wikileaks per se, by parties still aggrieved by the original emergence of the outfit. Wikileaks rose to fame years ago when it released streams of supposedly confidential but often revealing military and other government information of various countries around the world. The letter received by the Wikileaks shop made reference to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). A part of the published excerpt reads: “Coinbase is a regulated Money Service Business under Fincen,” and as such it is “obligated to implement regulatory compliance mechanisms.”  Coinbase claimed that, “Upon careful review,” the company felt that @Wikileaks’ account has “engaged in prohibited use in violation of our Terms of Service,” and went onto to “regret to inform [@Wikileaks]” that the exchange would no longer be able to provide services to their apparently formerly good client. The letter then goes on to detail instructions for Wikileaks to immediately withdraw whatever its remaining balance might be, in order to exit the platform. “We respectfully request that you follow the on-screen instructions presented when you log into your Coinbase account to send any remaining balance offsite to an external address,” the letter concludes. The polite tone has only further enraged @Wikileaks as it claims the essence is missing – the real reason for the termination – as no misconduct has been recorded in the past. It would appear that there is some spurious influence at play in the background, an undisclosed manipulative hand that remains unidentified in all of the comms it has received. As Wikileaks started calling for a global “blockade” of Coinbase, Andreas Antonopoulos, the best-selling Bitcoin author, weighed in on the issue by saying that “We have come full circle. Many people’s interest in Bitcoin started when Wikileaks was out under an extrajudicial embargo by Visa, Mc, Paypal and banks. Now Coinbase has repeated history. Oops.”  In the cryptocurrency community, a low-key battle has quietly taken shape at the interface between vested interests and the democracy and ease of blockchain currencies. Although Wikileaks has other issues to face at the moment, the accepted understanding across the world within the community, however, is that existing asset sectors will fight back when cryptocurrencies hurt their interests, but that this kind of authoritarian perversion of blockchain’s value needs to be named, shamed and avoided at all costs. Where exactly Coinbase’s recent machinations fit in isn’t clear, but their behavior is anathema to the majority of the cryptocurrency community. Responding to Coinbase’s actions, Wikileaks announced that it will call for a worldwide censure of Californian Coinbase, noting that its management had approved the decision yet obscured the rationale behind the move. Antonopoulos added that the Coinbase action was “purely symbolic, unlike the first embargo. Now [Wikileaks has] many options [to find a new exchange]. But the symbolism is a pretty poignant reminder of what centralization and banking regulations mean.” Antonopoulos was referring to a 2010 blockade of global, fiat Wikileaks payments, something that pushed the company to an early and public championing of Bitcoin. Six days prior to the maverick Satoshi Nakamoto’s silent exit from the community, a debate on the Bitcointalk forum was raging between Bitcoin founder Nakamoto and others who were promoting the notion of Bitcoin being embraced by Wikileaks. This poignant moment in time has been immortalized in Wikileaks founder Julian Assange’s book “When Google met Wikileaks.” It has always since been speculated that Nakamoto left in large part due to the pending politicization of his digital coin. Cheapair.com, a Coinbase vendor, has announced that it is quitting the platform, ostensibly after Coinbase announced recent amendments to merchant services. Coinbase is now no longer supporting custodial merchant processing solutions but has replaced them with a free, non-custodial solution. Cheapair.com has said it is exiting the platform as the new changes no longer enable its best interests nor the ease of use of its clients.",

Case in point, according to statements made by Binance’s chief executive, industry golden child Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the flagship exchange sports ten million users. While this is a jaw-dropping accomplishment in and of itself, the company unveiled plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) in 2018, as CZ touted the merits of non-intermediated transactions.  Little was known about the project until August 2018, when Zhao released a “casual, rough, and pre-alpha” sneak peek of the platform, which had no graphical user interface (GUI) to speak of at the time. Since that fateful date in August, the Chinese technology entrepreneur has kept the pedal to the metal, releasing a stream of videos, pictures, and statements about this nascent facet of Binance’s operations. This came to a head earlier this week, as CZ took to his Twitter page, which has command of the eyes and ears of 275,000 strong, to claim that as Lunar New Year celebrations have occurred, the Binance DEX team “continue to BUIDL.” Hinting that the release of the platform is near, Zhao added that not only was a testnet of Binance Chain — the DEX’s home field, so to speak — pushed to select partners, but integration with Ledger Nano hardware wallets is right around the corner. Released in tandem with this comment was an image of the yet-to-be-released Binance Block Explorer, clad in the defined, well-recognized, and yellow-tinted design that has become the upstart’s calling card.  Zhao went on to divulge more about his latest venture in a Q&A livestream. He explained that Binance Chain will utilize the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, while BNB will act as the network’s gas, just as ETH is for Ethereum. Binance’s fervent leader even quipped that due to the barebones nature of Binance Chain —  lack of a virtual machine means no smart contracts — the network should be able to generate one-second blocks, each of which pertains to “a couple thousand” transactions. Although Vitalik Buterin would argue that such high data throughput is bull, CZ seems adamant that his brainchild should be able to support the brunt of the transactional demand of tens of thousands of clamoring crypto consumers. In closing, doing his best to remain nebulous, Zhao noted that the DEX’s beta iteration will launch in the next “couple of weeks,” but was wary to divulge the planned release date for the final product. News regarding the DEX comes just after the company made a handful of announcements in recent weeks. Along with launching a crypto-to-fiat exchange in Jersey, which was met with copious levels of demand from European citizens, Binance secured a partnership with Simplex, allowing consumers to purchase cryptocurrencies through credit and debit cards. The industry upstart also partnered with Tron to host the ICO of BitTorrent token, a project based on the world-renowned torrenting ecosystem that shares its name. Binance’s incessant strides in the right direction have even caught the attention of Erik Voorhees, deemed “Bitcoin’s last gunslinger” by Forbes. In a recent tweet, the anti-establishment advocate, who is behind the ShapeShift Exchange, CoinCap, and KeepKey ventures, remarked that he’s “impressed and inspired” by the “incredible success” that Binance has achieved in recent memory. Voorhees went on to extoll Zhao, even remarking that he’s been keeping an ear to the ground, especially as the former OkCoin executive has scaled the rungs of the crypto world.  Binance may just be a mere fledgling in Bitcoin’s relatively long history. But with this statement at the forefront, many would argue that the company will continue to outshine its rivals, especially due to its ability to stay afloat in brutal, bone-crushing market downturns. The fact that BNB, the upstart’s in-house token, has surged to the upper echelons of the digital asset space only accentuates this theme. According to Blockonomi’s market analytics tool, BNB, soon to be issued on Binance’s very own blockchain, is now the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.",

        "passage": "It’s long been known that Swift and Ripple, two companies looking to streamline payment processes, have battled it out over who is a better platform. Well, the two CEO’s, Gottfried Leibbrandt and Brad Garlinghouse, respectively, had a public, face-to-face discussion as a part of the “Let’s Send the Money” panel at the Paris FinTech Forum 2019. Both argued over the future of cross-border payment solutions.  This discussion was moderated by Elizabeth Schulze, who works as a Technology Correspondent for CNBC International. She started the conversation with Leibbrandt, asking why Swift was the future over Ripple. He responded as follows: Primarily, his project uniquely identifies each payment made on the system and enables users to trace it from start to finish. The entire process is transparent, fast, and useful. He continues: Garlinghouse responded with an argument defending “the internet of value.” He compares the battle between both companies as similar to the one between Amazon and Walmart in 1997/1998, describing it as a “David and Goliath” fight. While Garlinghouse praised Swift’s payment system and recognized how it was a big achievement for traditional banking, he ultimately compared it to making a “horse and buggy” move faster than before instead of just buying a Ferrari: Swift originally wanted to use Ripple’s technology, which was brought up during the discussion. Here, Leibbrandt describes why they chose not to partner in the end: Right now, banks aren’t incredibly comfortable with XRP (Ripple’s currency) due to volatility. Swift’s technology works well with current banks, and it decreases their workload. Garlinghouse counters these claims, calling them full of misinformation. He believes that volatility is nowhere near as necessary, and that immediate transaction time is vital: Those interested can watch the whole argument here.",

        "passage": "In yet another sports-crypto collaboration, a Cleveland professional basketball team along with its esports league affiliate, Cavs Legion GC, has partnered with UnitedCoin. The partnership would create more awareness for the crypto project and also bring cryptocurrency and blockchain technology closer to the people. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are gradually gaining widespread acceptance among different sectors, and the sports industry seems to be appreciating the many benefits associated with the dynamic industry.  According to a press release by the National Basketball Association (NBA) on Monday (July 15, 2019), Cleveland Cavaliers (the Cavs) NBA 2k league, Cavs Legion, collaborated with cryptocurrency firm, UnitedCoin. The partnership would see Cavs Legion adopt UnitedCoin as its official cryptocurrency partner. Also, the alliance among the trio would create more publicity for UnitedCoin and provide the professional basketball team the means to capitalize on the fintech sector via cryptocurrency. In addition, in the NBA 2k League, the United Coin logo will be displayed on the home court of the Cavs League during gameplay. Also, the team would push UnitedCoin on all its social media handles. Commenting on the partnership, Cleveland Cavaliers’ President of Business Operations, Nic Barlage, said that the reason for collaborating with the cryptocurrency company was to stay abreast of happenings in the dynamic industry and create a better avenue for its fans. Furthermore, Barlage said: Derek Jones, Co-founder and CEO of UnitedCoin also saw the coalition as an avenue to bring cryptocurrency and blockchain technology closer to fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cavs Legion and also enlighten them on the benefits of cryptocurrency. Additional details about the partnership include LED signage inside the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the arena of the basketball team, during the games, and branding opportunities in the forthcoming 2019-20 season. There has been an increasing healthy partnership between the sports industry and the cryptocurrency sector. Blockonomi recently reported the collaboration between American football team, Miami Dolphins and Litecoin. According to the report, the team adopted Litecoin as its official cryptocurrency. Also, Portuguese football club, S.L. Benfica, became the first major European football team to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method, following its partnership with the cryptocurrency payment platform, Utrust. The collaboration enables Benfica fans to purchase merchandise and tickets using bitcoin, ether, and Utrust’s token, UTK. In December 2018, Litecoin announced the sponsorship of an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event that took place on December 29, 2018. Per the report at the time, the litecoin was leveraging on the millions of UFC viewers to promote cryptocurrency. Apart from partnerships and sponsorships between the nascent industry and the sports sector, there have also been cases of players being paid in crypto. Back in early 2018, Ted-Jan Bloemen, a skater, became the first Olympian to be paid in cryptocurrency. Also, Gibraltar United F.C., a Premier Division of the Gibraltar Football league, entered into a partnership that included payment of players’ salaries in cryptocurrency. While some players are getting paid in cryptocurrency courtesy of their clubs, some prominent players in the National Football League (NFL) are trying hard to get the league to pay them in crypto. Matt Barkley, Quarterback for Buffalo Bills, wanted the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals to pay his contract in bitcoin. The quarterback later revealed via Twitter that he was already mining bitcoin. Another NFL player, Russell Okung, also made a request on Twitter to be paid in bitcoin.",

        "passage": "Tech powerhouse Microsoft announced its latest contribution the Decentralized Identity Foundation on May 13th, and it was a big one: the enterprise released a preview of its new ION tool, a decentralized identity (DID) service built on top of the Bitcoin network.  Alex Simons, VP of Program Management, Microsoft Identity Division, noted that the tool, which has been characterized by its builders as “open public infrastructure,” had achieved the performance capabilities necessary to power worldwide usage: And why DID, then? For the sake of user empowerment, particularly with regard to privacy. Centralized identity mechanisms (e.g. account logins) have proven fragmentary, meaning users have had to trust their login info with disparate sources — some easier to compromise than others.  Yet ION is a developing stab toward leveraging encryption and Bitcoin to give users secure and self-owned ID, Simons said: For its part, Microsoft has been making increasing overtures to the realm of decentralized identity — which Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin recently told Elon Musk was solvable by blockchain tech — as of late. The company joined the ID2020 initiative last year, an effort focused on making blockchain-based ID systems a reality. Earlier this month, Microsoft partnered with banking giant JP Morgan on a deal that saw Morgan’s private fork of Ethereum, Quorum, as the first blockchain project available to build on via the Azure Blockchain Service, which Microsoft launched on May 2nd. That collaboration will make it easier for enterprise clients to build apps with Quorum. Likewise, on May 6th, Microsoft announced it was releasing a preview of an Ethereum development suite — the Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum — which offered a selection of relevant tools for builders. In April, Microsoft sponsored the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon, which saw hackers and entrepreneurs racing to build Ethereum-based projects for prizes. The company also joined the Token Taxonomy Initiative, which is seeking to coordinate tokenization standards across multiple public blockchain projects.  The venture capital wing of Microsoft, M12, also participated in a $182 million USD funding round for the high-profile forthcoming crypto exchange and futures platform, Bakkt, earlier this year. Taken altogether, the array of moves indicates Microsoft is doing much more than just its homework on the cryptoeconomy — the company is taking an active role in the space and positioning itself as an emissary to welcome other major institutions and enterprise into the crypto fold. Microsoft’s release of its ION preview was just one of a few big adoption headlines hitting the cryptoverse on May 13th. One such headline centered around the virtual marketplace eBay, as ads saying “Virtual currency. It’s happening on eBay” appeared on the premises of the Consensus conference during the event’s first day. Another thread that hit the fore on the 13th was a partnership between the crypto exchange Gemini and crypto network Flexa in a deal that will see major retailers like Nordstrom and GameStop accepting digital assets as a payments option going forward. Not bad for a Monday, right?",

        "passage": "Just two days after suddenly making demands for all customers identity documents, the company known as Hashflare has released an email hours ago titled “[IMPORTANT] End of Mining Service of SHA-256 Contracts”. According to the email, all current SHA-256 bitcoin mining contracts will be terminated today, July 20. Many on Twitter and Reddit are calling this an exit scam.  According to the email that just went out, the company has been unable to make any bitcoin payments to its contract holders for the last 28 consecutive days due to the amount earned being allegedly less than the daily maintenance fee the company charges. This, they claim, what is causing all contracts to be terminated prematurely. The email states that the company is within its rights to do this as the action is “in accordance with clause 5.5 of our Terms of Service, which are required to be accepted when creating a purchase and are the basis of concluding the contract.” Clause 5.5 of the terms of service reads: The terms seem to be unaltered, as an identical copy can be found on archive.org stretching back to at least last year. The community reaction has so far been overwhelmingly negative. Some users who joined the service just recently and stand to suffer the most loses have claimed that they are trying to perform a chargeback with their banks. Others are stating that they considering filing law suits against the Estonia-based company, but it’s too soon to tell whether or not anyone will proceed with legal action.  Another subset of users are questioning the legitmacy of Hashflare’s claim that mining is no longer profitable. Users are posting screen shots of mining calculator sites like Coinwarz.com which suggests that currently mining is profitable, especially considering the uptick in price that bitcoin has seen in the last week. But profitability is apparently not enough, as the terms seem to be that mining hasn’t to be profitable enough to pay for their own maintenance fees Other users had interesting comments to share, such as these:   Today’s announcement comes several months after Hashflare suddenly changed all pre-existing bitcoin mining contracts from being “lifetime” to one-year. That sudden change in policy which the company again justified via its contractual terms caused support for the company to plummet. That change seems moot, however, as all bitcoin mining contracts still faced cancellation in much the same way that we saw today.  Another point to consider is that just two days prior to this, the company suddenly started requiring all users to submit ID data to identify themselves. Users who failed to do so were told they could potentially lose access to their accounts if they failed to comply. The timing of this sudden requirement seems coincidental, and some users are suggested this was done as a protective measure against impending lawsuits. Redditor /u/urgodfather had a few things to say for those considering legal action. With this announcement, it is our guess that the community has likely lost all trust in Hashflare. The companies main competitor, Genesis Mining, appears to still be paying out and has not made any statement so far on Hashflare’s actions. Previously when Hashflare changed their contracts from life time to one-year, Genesis Mining released a statement saying they would never take advantage of legal jargon to act against their customers best interests. For those who currently have a balance on Hashflare, it appears that the previous withdrawal minimums of 0.02 BTC have been removed. However, the site is currently imposing a 0.01 BTC maximum daily withdrawal, which is around $75 at today’s prices. For users that previously had lifetime contracts, they will only be losing about a months worth of potential mining income as that change occurred 11-months ago. But for those that joined just recently, they stand to lose as much as a year of mining profits. It’s also quite likely that cloud mining itself will take a hit and fewer users will be willing to invest in it as a result of the collapse of Hashflare.",

        "passage": "When it comes to blockchain scaling, all roads lead to Rome. In other words, there are many routes to take. Notably, another route has just been forged yet via the Phonon Network, a proposed scaling solution for Bitcoin and Ethereum to start with and then further blockchains in the future. Announced this week by GridPlus co-founder Karl Kreder, the second-layer scaling solution has been designed by the GridPlus team — best known to date for developing the Lattice1 digital safe — as a so-called “hardware enforced off-chain payment system.”  Those familiar with the cryptoeconomy will recognize the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s proposed scaling solution) and Raiden Network (like Lightning, but designed for Ethereum) similarly as off-chain payment systems. Where GridPlus’s new network differs, though, is its payments — “packets” dubbed phonons — can be transacted directly between two participants without an intermediary, e.g. routing hubs. The system will be unfurled for the two biggest public blockchains first and will accordingly be blockchain agnostic, capable of working with both account-based blockchains like Ethereum and UTXO-based ones like Bitcoin. As for how it works, the network lets users transact with on-chain assets like bitcoin, ether, and tokens off-chain courtesy of a unique off-chain protocol and smart cards. These cards, which adhere to supported blockchains’ consensus rules, are secured by physically unclonable function (PUF) technology, which is also used to secure credit cards. This tech ensures that a card’s identity can’t be forged or changed, and the PUF is validated within each smart card by an ECDSA signature provided by the card’s manufacturer. Thanks to this design, the Phonon Network can mitigate double-spend attacks, as it won’t be feasible for malicious agents to compromise the cards to commandeer them. Notably, the network has been designed to work with smart cards tech in general, but the system will be immediately compatible with GridPlus’s in-house SafeCards product.  Phonons themselves will be packets of data attached to a given asset, for instance a single bitcoin or one ether. These phonons are “mapped” to a deposit address on the appropriate blockchain. A phonon transaction begins when two smart cards use an encrypted channel to transact a private key of phonon at hand. Thereafter, the smart cards would verify each other’s identities via certificates, at which point transaction details would be delivered to the receiver. The receiver’s card then pings the blockchain to check that the underlying asset (e.g. BTC, ETH) is where it’s said to be. If everything checked out, the receiver’s card would greenlight the transaction, and the sender would finally deliver the phonon, after which their card erases any memory of it. With the phonon now delivered, its receiver can deposit it on-chain as they wish. Altogether, the outlined second-layer network would be unique among its scaling contemporaries. As Kreder explained in his announcement post: This month has been an intriguing one for Lightning Network. With the latest LND software release, users can now run their own watchtowers — long-awaited tech designed to protect Lightning channels around the clock from attacks or accidental loss of funds. And word broke last week that a “Spectrum” protocol was in the works that would allow the issuance of colored coin tokens on Lightning. Beyond LN, also proposed this month was Utreexo, a Bitcoin scaling method that would make running a full node easier and cheaper. And the minds behind goTenna recently announced Lot49, a protocol for decentralized communications layer powered by bitcoin micropayments.",

        "passage": "Iran’s government is looking to provide tax breaks for bitcoin miners in the country. This move is the latest in a series of steps geared towards supporting the local crypto industry as a way of boosting the country’s economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues to see increased activity as the network hash rate approaches unprecedented levels. Participants in the market are even expanding their outlay with numerous data centers going live across the globe.  According to Iranian English news platform Financial Tribune, the country is set to offer tax holidays to bitcoin mining firms. Iran’s National Tax Administration (INTA) says that bitcoin miners who repatriate their foreign earnings will be eligible for tax exemptions. Usually, repatriating offshore earnings (converting overseas revenue into the local currency of the country where the company is based) comes with a significant corporate tax burden. For this reason, many companies elect not to repatriate their foreign revenue. As previously reported by Blockonomi, Iran’s government classifies cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity. Thus, bitcoin miners in the country have to pay federal taxes. The move to provide tax breaks in exchange for repatriated overseas earnings might constitute a significant stimulus for Iran’s fiat currency. Tehran has struggled with capital control policies amid a weakening economy and the return of U.S. sanctions. Iranian bitcoin miners, however, believe that the government shouldn’t have to worry about capital flight from their activities because 70% of their revenue ends being used to cover production costs. In recent times, authorities in Tehran seem to have stopped short of legalizing cryptocurrency as a whole in the country. The government has legalized cryptocurrency mining, creating a special electricity tariff for the activity. There was a slight standoff brewing between bitcoin miners and the government over power consumption. Data centers thronged to mosques across the country in a bid to enjoy free electricity. Iran’s electricity tariff is highly subsidized being more than 80% lower than the global average. Thus, bitcoin miners continue to flock into the country in search of cheap electricity. Even with the creation of a separate fee structure for cryptocurrency miners, the charges might still be significantly lower than in other countries where bitcoin mining is popular. Such is the extent of the increase in Iranian crypto mining activity that it decreased the global utilization of renewable energy in bitcoin mining. Data from Coinshares report saw a slight drop in this regard. Iran’s electricity generation is mostly from fossil fuel sourced from the country’s large oil deposits. While the government is encouraging bitcoin mining, cryptocurrencies themselves are still outlawed in the country. Citizens cannot use bitcoin and other digital coins are a means of payment. Also, mining companies can only sell mined cryptos on overseas exchanges. For Iranian authorities, encouraging crypto commerce could further dilute capital control efforts. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining activity continues to increase with the blockchain network hash rate setting new all-time highs. The Bitcoin Network hash rate is almost at 100 quintillion hashes per second. Hash rate refers to the computing power used to secure the blockchain network. To put things into perspective, Bitcoin’s current hash rate exceeds the approximate total number of grains of sand on the earth by more than 10 times. Companies like Northern Bitcoin are also expanding their financial outlay in the market, establishing new data centers. The emphasis continues to be on sustainable bitcoin mining using renewable energy sources. Reports say mining centers are becoming a buyer of last resort for clean energy.",

        "passage": "Despite positive expectations and enthusiasm on the benefits of the blockchain technology to companies, its integration has proven difficult. According to the research released by Greenwich Associates, the collated data and responses from executives from companies undergoing adoption of the distributed ledger technologies (DLT), has revealed that the process has been harder than expected. The study from Greenwich includes responses from various industries like banks, consultancy firms, technology vendors, dedicated blockchain companies, exchanges, and more.  The report identified various consistent and collective technical challenges that make the adoption of blockchain solutions so difficult. These include issues such as scalability, hardware security concerns, transaction confidentiality, and the handling of the payment component of the transactions. When the issue of scalability was raised, 42% responded identified it as a major problem, 30% called it a minor issue, while 19% didn’t encounter any challenge at all. Seven percent of the chief executives of the companies, however, view the issue of scalability as a significant problem. Author of the report and vice president at Greenwich Associates’, Richard Johnson, said the apparent discrepancy between scalability as an issue in blockchain companies and non-blockchain companies, could be as a result of a number of factors. Such problems could be “due to optimism on behalf of the blockchain companies and their technology,” or because “it represents the fact that a lot of the testing they have done has been in more of a demo environment. When you start connecting with the real world, that introduces latency and slows things down.” The report also revealed that a large number of the firms surveyed were yet to implement DLT transactions solutions, as those in production were still having issues with the slow transaction speed. 2% of the respondents have, however, gone over 15,000 transactions per seconds, a relatively high level of throughput. Blockchain, also referred to as distributed ledger technology came into the financial market scene a few years ago, due to its potential to correct some real-world issues faced in the financial markets. Such issues include a reduction in settlement time, operational costs and streamlining business processes. Companies have millions of dollars in the technology and the necessary workforce in a bid to apply the DLT to their business operation. However, Johnson remains optimistic about the potential and the future of the DLT, even though the ratio of those who have successfully implemented it is still quite small. “We’re beginning to see firms figure out how to get the blockchain to run fast and do a lot of transactions per second, and I think that’s encouraging,” he remarked. Despite being regarded as a “silver bullet” and regardless of the issues it comes with,  blockchain keeps increasing and is widely being adopted by companies to boost efficiency, reduce fraud and waste. The most recent employment of the blockchain technology would be IBM’s Food Trust product, which allows the company to use the technology to track the basis and logistics of perishable food items.  IBM also partnered with PWC, Adel and global legal firm Squire Patton Boggs recently in a bid to fast-track the development and adoption of the distributed ledger technology in the economic and public spheres of the Czech Republic. The main aim of the group is to enhance the Czech economy within the next five years with employment of blockchain, which is believed to be relevant in developing cryptocurrency solutions across sectors. Already in the loop of utilizing this technology includes huge corporations, like Tyson Foods, Nestle, Unilever, and Kroger. In an interview with CNBC, Joe Duran, the CEO of United Capital, talked about how excited he was regarding the future of blockchain technology stating that blockchain “is going to be part of every transaction that occurs in the world,” but adding that “It’s going to take a decade before it’s there.”",

        "passage": "Despite the collapse of the Bitcoin price through 2018, bankers and regulators still seem to be on their toes about cryptocurrency. After all, this newfangled asset class presents a threat to the traditional banking system and fiat monies, as something like BTC is neither directly controllable or taxable. So, it should come as no surprise that the Philippines, which some see as a hub for crypto adoption (I personally know many coworkers that live there), is looking to crack down on the industry.  Speaking to PhilStar Global, a local English media outlet, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) representative Benjamin Diokno said that his organization will continue to address the “risks” that come alongside the usage of cryptocurrency. Diokno, a governor of the institution, explained that he is worried about the usage of digital assets in terrorist financing, which is a pertinent issue with entities like Hamas and ISIS purportedly using Bitcoin to exchange value. With the Philippines experiencing an array of deadly bombings over recent years, it’s no surprise that the governor is on edge about this subject matter. This isn’t the only issue that the bank sees with cryptocurrencies, however. Diokno’s peer, deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo, told a crowd during the publishing of a Bitcoin-related book warned that BTC and its ilk aren’t viable as alternative forms of money. Guinigundo ventured that due to Bitcoin’s volatility, it would be hard to use it as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. He elaborates: Of course, a central banker wouldn’t be caught dead pushing any other narrative. Anyhow, the reason why there is this newfound scrutiny from the Philippines is seemingly a result of a report that from 2017 to 2018, the value of domestic cryptocurrency payments doubled. The report from PhilStar made no mention of explicit plans, but a crackdown is likely on the table, especially if more domestic money continues to flow into borderless, censorship-resistant digital assets. What’s interesting, the Philippines recently got its first Bitcoin automated teller. Announced earlier this year, the Union Bank of the Philippines, a banking giant that is the seventh largest in the country, launched two buy-and-sell cryptocurrency machines. Union Bank purportedly collaborated with the nation’s central bank, to ensure that this offering is compliant. The Philippines’ recent statements of concern in regards to cryptocurrency comes just days after Bloomberg Quint claimed that India is planning to eliminate all Bitcoin usage within its borders. The article, which cited a “draft bill”, revealed that regulators in India, from multiple financial and judiciary agencies, revealed that those who involve themselves in the “sale, purchase and issuance of all types” of crypto assets, including Bitcoin, could lead to a ten-year jail sentence and/or fine. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India and its partners have purportedly also proposed the creation of a “Digital Rupee” to fill in the void left by a ban on Bitcoin. This exact strategy has purportedly been “recommended by a panel headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg”, and has been backed by an array of other respected governmental agencies. Funnily enough, the Reserve Bank has since come out to state that it is unaware of any such bill, and that it hasn’t been in any contact with its regulator peers about a new cryptocurrency crackdown. Regardless, many pundits have stated that if India was to try and kill domestic Bitcoin use, it may backfire and actually result in adoption. This, of course, would be the Streisand Effect in action.",

        "passage": "It seems that the revival in the cryptocurrency markets has been heavily benefiting Square, a financial services and technology firm headquartered in San Francisco with a swelling love for Bitcoin. Per the firm’s latest shareholder letter, which was published on August 1st, Square made over $100 million in Bitcoin-related revenues, representing a small yet fair portion of its operations.  The shareholder states that in the second fiscal quarter of 2019, Square’s flagship product, payments app and lite-Bitcoin exchange Cash App, brought in $125 million in BTC revenue. Over 90% of revenue in Square’s subscription, services, and transaction bucket came from its barebones Bitcoin exchange, which supports simple buys and sells. Due to low profit margins in the exchange business, the firm made away with $2 million in Bitcoin-related gross profit. According to an analysis of the firm’s history with Bitcoin by The Block, Cash App’s BTC revenues are nearly double (90%) that of last quarter, during which the firm snagged $65.5 million in revenues. Q2 2019’s revenues are also up more than 240% since Q2 of 2018. The rapid uptick in interest can be attributed to two things: Firstly, the value of Bitcoin skyrocketed from the start of Q2 to the end of Q2. In fact, if Square follows a normal fiscal quarter, BTC rallied by approximately 200% during the quarter, moving from $4,000 to the $12,000 region. With this rapid swing higher, which caught many bears with their pants down, trading volumes across exchanges the industry over spiked, which was a trend supported by an increase in the mainstream coverage of cryptocurrency. Secondly, the so-called “stacking satoshis” movement, which sports the memorable hashtag #stackingsats, gained lots of traction this quarter. Popularized by Matt Odell, Marty Bent, American HODL, and other personalities on Bitcoin Twitter, this movement promotes the repeated purchase of small portions of BTC through Cash App. While it isn’t clear how much of Square’s Bitcoin revenues is related to devotees of the stacking movement, it likely hasn’t hurt. Square’s rapidly growing Bitcoin exchange business comes as the fintech firm’s crypto division has brought on its first staffer. Announced back in mid-June, the Jack Dorsey-headed firm brings on Steve Lee, a former director of Google, where he headed work on Google Maps, and an ongoing evangelist for and contributor to Bitcoin. The Silicon Valley veteran also is an angel investor of Lyft, Pinterest, and other technology startups. It isn’t clear exactly what Lee’s role is at Square Crypto, or what the Google alumnus is currently working on. The firm is currently looking for open blockchain developers but has been quite picky with who to choose, claiming that it has received over “1,500” resumes. Square is expected to make its first developer hire in the coming weeks. By the end of the hiring period, chief executive of both Square and Twitter, Jack Dorsey, will have handpicked one or two designers and three to four blockchain developers. Dorsey’s vision is to promote the viability and use of public blockchains. For now, Square Crypto’s staff will be focusing on Bitcoin. In a recent “ask me anything” on Twitter, Lee took some time to answer some of the crypto community’s inquiries about the project. During that, Lee explained that his division will be “focusing on Bitcoin”, noting that it has the longest lifespan of any cryptocurrency and needs to be worked on a lot to achieve mass adoption. This lines up with the vision put forth by Dorsey, which he has shared with comedian-turned-legendary podcaster Joe Rogan and cryptocurrency-friendly outlet Quartz. He said through those outlets that he believes that Bitcoin is best suited to become the Internet’s native currency.",

During a recent Bloomberg TV segment, Erik Voorhees, dubbed “Bitcoin’s Last Gunslinger” by Forbes, did his best to weigh in on this topic, lending his insight as one of the earliest entrepreneurs to flip bullish on the idea of digital, immutable, decentralized, non-sovereign and censorship-resistant money.  Getting right to the point, Voorhees postulated that Bitcoin’s cyclicity of continual booms and busts, parabolic run-ups and breathtaking drawdowns, and what have you is the biggest catalyst behind this move. He explains that investors across the board are all coming to the conclusion that the bottom is finally in, and have begun to scale into the market collectively. “Often, these things are a confluence of many individuals making the same decision,” Voorhees elaborates, concluding that the move is likely not the byproduct of a single “whale” or group of large investors and market makers. He goes on to state that parabolic price action, like what we are seeing now with Bitcoin, is entirely normal, nay, mandated to bring the cryptocurrency space from zero to trillions.  Some, however, have claimed that this move is entirely predicated off a positive news cycle. In a recent thread posted on Twitter, researcher Alex Krüger notes that “large players” participating in “systematic buying” was what drove the cryptocurrency market. He looked to “volume, price action, funding, and futures basis and term structure” to come to his conclusion: the move was “not retail driven.” Per Krüger, investors are likely trying to  “front run” a series of positive news events. These include but are not limited to Fidelity’s Bitcoin trade execution service, Bakkt’s crypto futures, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade getting into the cryptocurrency game, and retail chains across the U.S. indirectly accepting cryptocurrency payments. Data would seemingly confirm this. On Monday, the CME’s Bitcoin futures vehicle saw 33,677 contracts traded on Monday, amounting to 168,385 paper BTC. In a similar fashion, the Digital Currency Group’s subsidiary Grayscale was revealed Monday to have seen its flagship product, its Bitcoin Trust, post $141 million in volume today on markets. Both of the aforementioned vehicles are known to be institutional-centric. Regardless of what caused the move, BTC is running at long last, and this is enough to get some investors’ hearts racing. While many are divided on where Bitcoin can move next, the consensus is upwards. As Blockonomi reported previously, Fundstrat’s resident cryptocurrency permabull, Thomas Lee, remarked that there are an array of clear signs pointing towards the theory that soon enough, BTC and its altcoin brethren may see new all-time highs. Lee specifically looked to the following factors: the developments seen at Consensus; Bitcoin holding above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level; developments on the financialization of cryptocurrency (; long-time digital asset “hodlers” and “whales” bolstering their positions; and, most importantly, the idea that Bitcoin has begun to near the “FOMO” range of $10,000. Newfound demand sparked from these aforementioned catalysts should be a massive tailwind, Lee suggests. Even if Bitcoin somehow pulls back from here, returning to levels at which retail investors have forgotten about the space, one thing is for certain: the industry is now in much better shape than it was 18, even 12 months ago. As Tyler Winklevoss, a founder of Gemini, explained on Twitter on Thursday, “Bitcoin breaking 8k this time feels a lot different than the last time. So much progress has been made since then and it’s only the bottom of the first inning!”  And as Interchange co-founder adds, during the last Bitcoin bull run, we didn’t have names like Square (in the form of Cash App and Jack Dorsey), Fidelity Investments, Bakkt, ErisX, and Robinhood all delving into this industry.",

        "passage": "Whilst Spanish regulators have made their viewpoints on more stringent cryptocurrency and blockchain assets regulation somewhat clear-cut, this hasn’t stopped a major Spanish bank from announcing that they will be using the technology to facilitate a green bond issuance. The financial institution in question – Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), are Spain’s second largest bank.  As per the BBVA official website, the news confirms that structured green bonds will be supported by the blockchain protocol. The announcement indicates that the structure will be in collaboration with Mapfre, a Spanish insurance company. The aforementioned firm will be investing 35 million EUR in to the project, which has the overarching aim of facilitating financial products whilst remaining sustainable. The press release itself states that BBVA “issued the first structured green bond using blockchain technology to negotiate the terms and conditions,” For those unaware, a green bond operates in a similar way to traditional investment bonds, although there are some clear differences. First and foremost, as the name suggests, a green bond is linked specifically to investment projects that center on sustainable projects. This can include a range of green initiates such as pollution prevention, sustainable forestry and fishery, water management, clean transportation and eco-technologies. Not only this, but due to the nature of the underlying projects linked to green bonds, governments often give financial institutions certain tax benefits, and in some cases, outright tax exemption. In fact, according to rating agency Moody’s, global investment in green bonds surpassed $93 billion in 2016, further illustrating investor appetite for financial products that aim to make a difference. When it comes to the deal struck by BBVA and Mapfre, the 35 million EUR that was invested will be based on a 6 year term, with the underlying currency rate based on a 5 year Euro swap rate. According to the Chief Investment Officer at Mapfre – José Luis Jiménez: The CIO continued by adding that the project is potentially the first of many, with other sustainable investment-based products possibly on the way. On the other hand, this isn’t the first time that BBVA have involved themselves in blockchain technology. For example, in November 2018, it was reported that BBVA bank would be utilizing their blockchain network to facilitate a 150 million EUR loan. The deal, which was also in collaboration with major financial institutions BNP Paribas of France and MUFG of Japan, would be loaned to Red Electrica Corporation. The loan arrangement was fully supported by blockchain technology throughout the end-to-end process, with data represented on a secure ledger built on top of the Ethereum protocol. Prior to this, April 2018 saw BBVA bank close a 75 million EUR loan arrangement using distributed ledger technology. Ultimately, the usage of blockchain technology to facilitate inter-bank financial transactions has long been discussed as a potential solution to the current status quo. At present, the process of issuing corporate loans is a long, complex and highly inefficient process which requires a significant number of manual interactions. Not only this, but traditional methods of performing high-value corporate loans are hugely costly. On the contrary, blockchain technology allows financial institutions to initiate fast, low-cost and efficient transactions, with the framework often noted for its immutable characteristics.",

        "passage": "Adoption comes in many shapes and forms. Fidelity Investments is actively exposing thousands of institutional investors to crypto assets through its offering. Technology giant IBM is allowing Fortune 500 corporations to get their hands on blockchain technologies. Rakuten, in Japan, is pushing local consumers to use Bitcoin in their stores through discounts — you get the point. While the list of adopters of this newfangled innovation is as diverse as ever, this changes with a recent addition. Felix Kjellberg, a Swedish Youtuber that is best known as “PewDiePie,” seems poised to delve into the blockchain space with a recently announced sponsor. Kjellberg, by many measures, is the most diverse entity to have made a play in the blockchain space.  In Kjellberg’s latest edition of “Meme Review,” a segment in which the content creator breaks down the latest (and greatest) memes, PewDiePie opened his segment by touting a platform by DLive, an up-and-coming streaming platform. While this is normal, as the so-called “King of Youtube” with 93 million subscribers often takes up sponsorships with technology companies, what was cool (to us anyway) was that DLive is a platform centered around blockchain. Kjellberg, in fact, mentioned the word twenty seconds into his sponsorship spiel. As PewDiePie explains: As you likely have guessed, this startup’s ploy is to provide creators and users with a crypto asset. DLive’s digital asset is based on the lesser-known Lino blockchain, built using Cosmos technology, and is paid out to creators and can be obtained by consumers of content. What makes DLive better over, let’s say, the Amazon-owned Twitch is that the company doesn’t take any earnings from its users. It isn’t clear how far PewDiePie intends to take this business relationship, other than the fact that he will be live streaming on the platform next week. However, as of the time of writing this, 2.5 million viewers have been subject to 80 seconds of pro-blockchain content, and that’s arguably a good thing. This is actually the second time that the popular video gamer has publicly delved into the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Last year, as the initial coin offering boom was still ongoing, PewDiePie took part in a promotional video for a cryptocurrency project, providing something known as “SgamePro” with one-minute of footage. This video never made it to the PewDiePie channel, but it was uploaded by the SgamePro team likely in a bid to draw traffic to its product.  It is important to note that, whether warranted or not, controversy has been an integral part of Kjellberg’s long-lived career. In years past, the world-renowned Youtuber has been accused by mainstream media outlets on multiple occasions for fostering racism and bigotry through his videos. In fact, many deemed PewDiePie a closeted racist, as some of his videos were purportedly misinterpreted as promoting anti-Semitic beliefs and he once overtly used an unprintable slur in a “Player Unknown: Battlegrounds” Youtube livestream. Whether the full extent of the accusations is true is up for debate. The Youtuber has debunked some claims on many occasions, remarking that not only are some accusations decidedly false but that he has also taken major strides to bolster his image and the soundness of his beliefs in the past 24 months. His dozens of millions of fans would agree. Regardless, some in the blockchain space and in the general public may take issue with PewDiePie’s reportedly spotty past, and try to paint his shortcomings into a false narrative about this innovation. No matter what you think of PewDiePie’s ideology and the related dilemmas he has found himself in, it is likely that his recent move to team up with DLive will end up benefiting blockchain, rather than harming it outright.",

        "passage": "The lure of making a fortune online can prove an irresistible proposition for even the most level-headed among us. It requires a strong constitution to watch those little green percentages rise higher and higher every day without throwing at least some of your money at them. Trading in cryptocurrency has become more widespread, and more concentrated in the past year, as the market skyrocketed towards the end of 2017.  And now we’re starting to see the side-effects of having an accessible, volatile, but possibly immensely profitable source of market speculation that even the average internet user can get involved in.  Occurrences of cryptocurrency addiction are becoming so widespread that the medical industry is now starting to take notice. Earlier this week, The Castle Craig Hospital in Scotland launched an initiative aimed at treating people who have become addicted to cryptocurrency trading.  Castlecraig Hospital in Scotland Chris Burn, the resident gambling therapist at Castle Craig, equated trading in cryptocurrencies to a form of gambling, he told news.com.au: Perhaps it’s the accessibility of cryptocurrency which makes it so dangerous. A quick glance as the NASDAQ market index is enough to discourage anyone from investing in stocks. However, the infrastructure for crypto trading is a lot more welcoming. First of all, it’s all just a click away at all times. Then you have easily found market statistics on sites like CoinMarketCap. At the same time there’s an internet subculture where fellow traders can unite and discuss their strategies on forums like BitcoinTalk and Reddit. Gambling therapist Burn proposed that crypto gambling follows the same patterns as any other type of gambling, and is used as an escape mechanism. He said: The Castle Craig clinic has released an in-depth guide on their website, where they pose ten questions to determine whether or not you may be addicted to cryptocurrency trading.  Cryptocurrency Addiction Questions, Image from Castlecraig If you answered ‘yes’ to just one of those questions, the clinicians say that this could be enough of a sign that you may need help. Giving three ‘yes’ answers is considered a clear sign of cryptocurrency addiction and you should seek medical help before your addiction gets out of control. Answering in the affirmative five times or more is classed as a sign that your crypto addiction has reached “pathological” levels, and you should seek help immediately. While Reddit might not be a dedicated psychological therapy website, sometimes its users do use it in that way. Cryptocurrency sub-reddits are filled with posters voicing concern about their trading addiction. One post was typical among the self-confessed addicts on the forum, it said: Another typical comment concerned how cryptocurrency seemed to take priority over other things in life: The vast majority of these posts have come in the last year, and it’s no coincidence why. There were almost no stories of cryptocurrency addiction prior to 2017 – ‘the year of cryptocurrency’. Online gambling has been around in some form for as long as the internet has existed. But just what is the difference between gambling and trading? Stock traders will say that the defining difference between trading stocks and cryptocurrency is that with stocks you actually gain a stake in a physical company, whereas with cryptocurrency you’re merely hoping that your coins might be worth something some day. However this is to neglect an important aspect about cryptocurrency – namely that many of the most profitable crypto platforms actually offer a real-world service, and often launch with a minimum viable product (MVP) already in place. In this sense, a typical stock market IPO is no different from an ICO. Investors choose the project which they think has market potential, and they back that project with their money in the hope of making a profit down the line. The gambling aspect is just as prevalent on the trading floor as it is on the crypto exchange. Companies rise and fall every day and there’s no sure-fire way of knowing which is going to be successful. There’s a reason why jumping out the top floor of their New York office building is not an uncommon way for stock speculators to meet their end. The Castle Craig addiction guide recommends direct medical treatment for cryptocurrency addiction, but if for some reason this is not an option for you then they recommend the following steps. Crypto addiction was always going to rear its ugly head, not least because 10-15% of the population naturally have what’s called an ‘addictive personality’, which makes them particularly susceptible to all forms of addiction. Likewise, the NHS states that 1 in 3 people in the U.K alone are addicted to some kind of substance or negative behavior. Crypto addiction will undoubtedly fuel another round of media furor targeted at the crypto industry and the problem can only increase as more people become involved in this new sector of finance. If you feel like you may be developing an addiction to cryptocurrency trading, please seek help from family, friends or a professional as soon as possible.",

        "passage": "In 2018, HTC, the Taiwan-based technology giant and smartphone manufacturer, shocked the crypto world when it unveiled plans to launch a blockchain device. This marked the first time that a large technology corporation had revealed it was putting serious capital behind a cryptocurrency product. Unlike many other industry ventures and contrary to critics’ expectations, HTC’s “Exodus 1 (One),” as the phone has been dubbed, launched successfully, seeing adoption from industry figureheads like Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. According to a report from technology media and local sources, the Exodus team will be releasing the second generation of its flagship smartphone, presumably to keep up with the ever-changing smartphone market and add new features.  On Monday, DigiTimes reported that according to Phil Chen, the C-suite-level head of HTC’s blockchain division, Exodus 1 will soon have a successor. Purportedly speaking at a recent event in Tapei, he explained that “in addition to supporting the management of cryptocurrencies and related technologies,” along with the security of digital assets/collectibles, the unnamed successor will include blockchain-enabled applications for browsing, messaging, social media, among other areas. An exact launch date was not mentioned, but Chen noted that users should expect the new device by the end of 2019. Chen goes on to state that the sales of the Exodus 1, which sports a specialized and secure wallet solution, have met his firm’s expectations, adding that there has been considerable demand from cryptocurrency investors and “startups which engage in” the trading of assets in this new class. This news comes just weeks after Proof of Capital, a venture capital fund backed by HTC and headed by Chen, went live. For those who missed the memo, Proof of Capital, named evidently in a play on the Proof of Work cryptography system popularized by Bitcoin, is a venture fund backed by Chen, who created HTC’s Vive headset, Edith Yeung, and Chris McCann, that currently has $50 million in capital. Investors in the fund include HTC, Youtube co-founder Steve Chen, and a former executive of Ripple Labs. Proof of Capital, according to a press release obtained by Blockonomi, is expected to invest in “market-transforming companies” in the blockchain ecosystem, especially those that involve identity, payment, custody, and data security. This is all being done to fulfill Proof of Capital’s mission: To some skeptics, a “blockchain phone” may sound questionable, but Phil Chen claims that Exodus is of utmost importance. In an interview with me, he furthered explained his thoughts on the matter. When asked about the importance of Exodus, Chen remarked that if you boil the smartphone down, he thinks it’s the “only phone that empowers users to own their private keys.” He adds that this simple feature is a “foundational principle” of the decentralized web, which cryptocurrencies are and will continue to be integral too. On the matter of why owning one’s own private keys is essential, Chen tells me that consumers should care about their personal data, as “the way we are trading small conveniences in exchange for micro invasions of privacy,” has “major ramifications,” even for democracy.

        "passage": "According to Justin Sun, founder and Chief Executive Officer of TRON (TRX), the public sale of BitTorrent tokens (dubbed BTT by its developers) was a “tremendous success,” after the token sale was able to raise millions of dollars in less than 20 minutes. The BitTorrent token public sale, which was organized on Launchpad, a token sale platform operated by Binance, ended in the sale of over 59 billion tokens. The sale was initially split into two sessions: the first was for investors who were purchasing BTT with Binance Coin (BNB), while the other was for investors who were buying the BTT tokens with TRX. A confirmation by Sun revealed that at the end of the trading day, the TRX-BTT trade saw the sale of 35.64 tokens, while 23.76 billion BTT tokens were traded in 13 minutes.  The BTT tokens were sold at a price of $0.00012 per token. After only just 15 minutes, the tokens were completely sold out, with $7.2 million raised. In his statement, Justin Sun said, “We had tremendous success during our crowdfunding on Binance Launchpad, which sold out in less than 15 minutes amidst a very positive response, right before the Q2 launch of BitTorrent Speed and its accompanying products. The BTT token will be instrumental in its ability to incentivize users on BitTorrent, to share and seed [media] on the platform.” BitTorrent was acquired by Justin Sun and TRON last summer, in a deal that reportedly made TRON the biggest decentralized exchange in the world, as BitTorrent was added to its suite of platforms. Although it was reported that Sun was in the process of purchasing the company in 2017, the Chinese entrepreneur eventually put together a letter of intent in January 2018. News of a new tokenized file sharing system was first circulated in September 2018. However, BitTorrent Speed, which was announced earlier this month, is expected to launch later in the year. The BitTorrent sale was met with criticism from various quarters, especially considering the capacity of the TRON blockchain to handle the volume of transactions going through the BitTorrent platforms on a daily basis. Speaking in an interview with BreakerMag, Simon Morris, former Chief Strategy Officer at BitTorrent, said that the integration of a token to prioritize downloads on the platform could very well reduce the network’s speed by about 40 percent. Morris stated that the TRON blockchain could not handle the transaction volume that the BitTorrent system would need, adding that while he served at BitTorrent’s CSO, his team required hundreds of transactions to begin. The BTT token, which is run on the TRON blockchain, will be a major part of BitTorrent’s latest sharing system, BitTorrent Speed. The whitepaper for BitTorrent Speed shows that users will get BTT tokens in exchange for “seeding” content with their bandwidth and file space. It is expected that clients’ increased use of BitTorrent Speed will help enhance the file sharing process on BitTorrent, one of the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing platforms. However, despite the massive success of the deal and the amount of money raised, the sale did experience certain difficulties as well. The enormous traffic on the Binance Launchpad overwhelmed the trading platform, making it difficult for some investors to acquire the tokens. “Both sessions concluded. Took about 18 minutes, due to a system issue, would have taken 18 seconds otherwise. Demand was astronomical,” Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao explained. However, Sun, via a tweet, opined that everyone who was unable to take part in the sale, could get some tokens via airdropping efforts. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, agreed to the suggestion and announced that the airdrop would take place. However, details have not yet been revealed.",

        "passage": "The state of the Bitcoin network and its associated cryptocurrency? Strong and getting stronger, it would seem. On July 9th, cryptoverse stakeholders watched as it became harder than ever before to mine on the genesis blockchain, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rate having spiked to over 9 trillion hashes per second (T) for the first time during the day’s early hours.  The development comes amid that rate uptrending since the beginning of the year — the waning weeks of last year’s cryptoeconomy bear market saw Bitcoin’s mining difficulty sink as low as 5 T. The rate’s all-time high in 2018 had been around 7.5 T, a former peak that was crossed again on May 30th, 2019. The ascension has continued to date, with the difficulty of winning bitcoin mining rewards once more reaching unprecedented heights as of this week. Moreover, the rate’s climb is expected to continue. As of Tuesday, bitcoin mining pool BTC.com has projected BTC mining difficulty will hit over 10.3 T later this month. If that projection were to actualize, the difficulty rate — which self-adjusts approximately every two weeks, namely after lots of 2,016 blocks — would have spiked by more than 14 percent from its current position. To be sure, the growth indicates that new miners are joining the network in droves, as mining difficulty grows in kind as more miners come online. That dynamic matches with comments made last month by Steven Mosher, marketing and sales lead with mining company Canaan Creative. At the time, Mosher noted his company had seen an acute explosion of demand for mining hardware that was then outpacing supply. “It looks like a return to the 2017 Q3 [and] Q4 conditions, where demand was three times the supply,” he said. For example, plenty of ASIC hardware will be needed by miner startup Plouton Mining, which announced plans in June to open up a 50 acre solar-powered bitcoin mining site in the California desert. In the summer of 2017, the BTC dominance rate — the bitcoin market cap’s share of the entire cryptoeconomy’s market capitalization — plummeted to the unprecedented low of 39 percent. At the time, many thought the prospects of the top altcoins had never seemed higher. But in the wake of the 2018 bear market, it’s been bitcoin that has come out enjoying renewed dominance, with the BTC dominance rate now at 63 percent — the highest it’s been since April 2017 before that year’s bull run ripped into gear. That reality has reinforced the belief held by some in the space that after the 2017 cryptoverse bubble many token projects would never recover. In other words, bitcoin has remained king of the hill as smaller projects have waned. The renewed optimism around the OG cryptocurrency has been reflected in its price as of late. Hovering around $12,500 at press time, bitcoin is now up 88 percent on the year, up 139 percent over the last three months, and up 1,928 percent over the last five years. It’s this performance record — one that’s been uncorrelated with traditional markets and more impressive than the recent performance of safe haven assets — that have more people saying bitcoin is a proper safe haven asset itself. So what happens next? Steadily increasing amounts of institutional involvement would be a fair guess. CME Group’s bitcoin futures contracts have seen impressive and growing volume lately, and Bakkt — the long-waited crypto exchange being backed by the owner-operators of the NYSE — will begin trialing its own bitcoin futures product this month. Such increased institutional involvement could serve to lend to Bitcoin’s mining difficulty and dominance rate for the foreseeable future. Alas, its mainstream legitimization as a commodity could end up making Bitcoin that much more dominant.",

By venturing into the world of blockchain technology, Gustav Gerig becomes the latest in a long list of companies to adopt the increasingly ubiquitous technology in their manufacturing processes. The company is also making history as the first food importer in Europe to ensure its range of fish products are completely traceable from the initial fishing process till its processed in cans, through the blockchain. This way, customers are well informed ascertain the origin of the company’s tuna range with the Ethereum blockchain. The company believes that by providing a completely optimal level of transparency in their operations, they will give their customers the ability to access valuable data regarding how the Pacifial MSC tuna moves through the supply chain. Information to be made available to customers will include the captain of the ship or vessel, the timing of a particular catch, the catching technique, the area where the catch was made, as well as the location and timing of processing.  Read: Blockchain & Supply Chain Management With the integration of the blockchain technology into its production process, Gustav Gerig is hoping to bolster its position as a leader in innovation among food manufacturers in Switzerland. However, most importantly, the focus is to be able to provide customers with more sustainable goods which they can trust and rely on. The technology is being provided by Atato, a Thailand-based provider of blockchain-related, services that help to develop decentralized applications for businesses and enterprise customers. Ever since it was founded last year in Bangkok, Atato, in partnership with ConsenSys, has been leading various innovations using the blockchain technology, across a wide range of applications. Quality control giant JMB International Thailand, with extensive years of experience in the tuna industry, will be handling the final product and packaging of the “Raimond Freres” brand for this project. JMB International is based in Thailand, and the company has been operating for over 30 years in the tuna industry, ensuring the creation of quality products, from the manufacturing to the delivery stage. Every MSC tuna product that is covered under this partnership will be identifiable through the Pacifial logo on the can lids. Customers who will like to access specific data about the tuna will have to scan the QR code on the can’s label, and they will be given access to the details on the blockchain. Once on the website, the customer will need to enter the unique Pacifial tracking code that came with the can. This code is unique to every can, and it can be found on the lid as well, close to the Pacifial logo in question. The use of blockchain technology for tracing agricultural products is one of its most widely adopted applications for the nascent technology. Earlier this week, the government of South Korea announced that it plans to make use of the blockchain to trace beef and provide customers with reliable information concerning the food supply chain. The initiative will be launched by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, in conjunction with the Ministry of Science and ICT, and both ministries have set December for the testing phase. The system is set to be officially launched in January 2019. According to a report by Yohnap News Agency, distributed ledger technology will be used to track the supply chain of beef so customers have the relevant information about the food they consume.",

        "passage": "During the last months and years, we have heard how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were growing in price. Most of the cryptocurrency market has experienced important growth rates and has helped investors to become rich, or even millionaires. Bitcoin has given monetary freedom to people all over the world. Those who invested at the very beginning are now enjoying their profits. Most of these investors have been showing off their new luxury cars (Lambos) or their trips to exotic places, but just a few of them have decided to invest in charitable causes. One of the exceptions to the rule is The Pineapple Fund.  The Pineapple Fund was started by an early-bitcoin investor who bought Bitcoin when its price was worth just a few dollars. The user did not know that years later, each Bitcoin was going to be worth up to $20,000 dollars, as of December 2017. Approximately three months ago, a Reddit post became famous for offering 5057 BTC to charitable causes. The user decided to call it “The Pineapple Fund.” “I remember starting at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I though that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15 $20.. $30.. wow! Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don’t believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money that I can ever spend,” says the post. “My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. And here is the interesting part: As of today, The Pineapple Fund has donated $54.3 million dollars and has supported 60 charities all over the world, according to its official website. At the moment The Pineapple Fund is not accepting applications anymore, but interested individuals can still donate to the project.  Media from all over the world has been covering how The Pineapple Fund was working with different charities and offering its Bitcoins. For example, The Chronicle of Philantropy, has written the story of Linda Tannembaum, which received $1 million dollars for her medical-research charity.  The donations from The Pineapple Fund range between $50,000 and $5,000,000 million dollars. Depending on the request submitted, the fund decided to give more, less or the amount requested by the charity. It is important to mention that the fund did not donate BTC to individuals, just to registered charity organizations, to avoid confusing episodes or future problems. Among the organizations that received Bitcoin from The Pineapple Fund we find the following: We are able to keep writing about the different fields to which this fund has donated, from medicine to environment protection. All of the registered organizations that received founds are very grateful to The Pineapple Fund and now they will be able to keep working on their activities knowing that they have found an important support within the cryptocurrency community. Apparently, all the remaining Pineapple Fund proceeds have been allocated, but the fund is still open to receive comments, suggestions or even donations. The Pineapple Fund is also inspiring other donors to keep funding different projects, because the donations do not end there. Several organizations that have received money from The Pineapple Fund have received additional donations from other individuals and enterprises. According to Chase Adam, co-founder of Watsi, since The Pineapple Fund funded them, the organization received $500,000 from another anonymous donor. Pine, the name received by the individual behind the fund, explained that he analyses very careful the projects before giving them some money. The three things that they analyze are: In general, cryptocurrency news and topics are mostly covered by specialized magazines, crypto webpages or blockchain technology sites. But this specific case was so important for the society, that very known traditional newspapers covered the story in a very detailed way. For example, the New York Times wrote: Other important news channels and newspapers that covered the story are: BBC Radio, Business Insider, Forbes, CNBC, Newsweek, The Guardian and TNW among others. In Reddit, The Pineapple Fund post received over 20K ‘likes’ and almost 3.000 comments. Two of the most important comments say: “Wow, this much better than all these stupid lambo posts. Respect.” “Exactly. OP is a good human being and they have my respect whomever they are. Spread the Love!.” Several times we have heard that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are “virtual money” or “fake money.” Individuals do not know what Bitcoin really is, but it is starting to leave an important mark in our history. The Pineapple fund is helping to show that Bitcoin is not always about crime, tax evasion or terrorist financing. Several countries do not allow the use of cryptocurrencies meaning that they also close the doors to individuals or institutions that want to help make a better world. Hundreds of people thanked Pine on Reddit and on an Open Medicine, with a Tracy saying: Behind every single project, every single Bitcoin donated, there are lives. There are hopes and dreams. Bitcoin and The Pineapple Fund are showing the world that good people exist.",

India continues to double down on its anti-crypto leanings with reports of an impending blanket ban. Meanwhile, more exchanges are leaving the country due to lack of access to banking services.  In an open letter to Prime Minister Modi, Barchha stated that the country’s central bank approach to the cryptocurrency sector was killing the industry in India, as the government wasn’t forthcoming with regulatory policies regarding cryptocurrency. An excerpt from the letter reads: There is a deafening silence on the future of crypto industry with regard to regulations, and this kills the dreams of budding entrepreneurs like us. I do understand the government’s concern over the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, and their possible use for money laundering or terrorist financing. In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prohibited commercial banks from providing services to persons or business involved in cryptocurrency trading or dealing with virtual coins. The ban comes after the apex bank repeatedly warned citizens about the risks involved with trading or dealing with virtual currencies. RBI’s announcement meant that crypto exchanges in the country would soon be out of business, as users needed banks to be able to carry out a transfer from their savings accounts to wallets. Subsequently, customers would have to use peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange platforms like LocalBitcoins and Bisq to trade virtual currencies. Consequently, several exchanges and the cryptocurrency community in India challenged the central bank’s decision in court. A case that has seen lots of back and forth in more than one year. However, in February 2019, Blockonomi reported that India’s Supreme Court gave the Indian government four weeks to come up with a defined regulatory policy regarding cryptocurrencies. Failure to come up with a policy within the stated time frame would mean that the apex court would deliver its judgment. The RBI ban in 2018 had its toll on crypto exchanges, including Kunal Barchha’s. In the letter, the CoinRecoil chief stated that the company tried to challenge the central bank’s directive through legal means. Barchha further stated that the startup was doing just fine until the government’s policies threw a spanner in their works. According to Barchha, the legal proceedings have put a dent in the company’s finances. CoinRecoil is one of many Bitcoin exchanges negatively affected by the RBI ban. In 2018, Zebpay, the largest virtual currency exchange in India at the time, closed cryptocurrency activities in India and moved to Malta. The company also expanded its services to Australia in May 2019. Another India-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinme, packed up and left the country, in the face uncertain regulatory policies. More recently, the RBI ban forced Koinex to also shutdown cryptocurrency services in India, joining the list of Indian exchanges leaving the country. According to the CoinRecoil co-founder, the government was carrying out decisions regarding the industry without researching or liaising with stakeholders in the industry. Buttressing the above point, Kunal Barchha said: “In the RTI filed last year, it was revealed that RBI didn’t do any sort of research before issuing the circular. Nearly 3 million people were utterly bereft of their money by that one piece of paper. Few of the government officials commented that the Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitely repeatedly warn about its usage. Also, RBI cautioned the users about it.” Barchha added that the government was dependent on decisions made by foreign regulatory agencies, instead of discussing with its citizens regarding the crypto space. However, Barchha stated that the solution to the government’s problems was the need to be open-minded with crypto stakeholders, as rigidity wouldn’t work. Furthermore, the co-founder stated that crypto exchanges in the country are willing to ensure that their platforms aren’t used for money laundering purposes. Also, adequate support from the government would mean that crypto startups in the country would device better ways to reduce the government’s tension.",

        "passage": "Decentralized oracle network Chainlink continues to rack up high-profile mainstream embraces, with the latest oncomers being the startup arm of American computer tech powerhouse Oracle — one of the biggest software companies in the world. Fernando Ribeiro, senior manager with Oracle for Startups, and Pablo Freitas, an engineer with Oracle’s Customer Innovation Labs, announced the meld on June 25th at the CloudEXPO conference in Santa Clara, California.  The collaboration, which Ribeiro said had been in the works months, entails Oracle’s blockchain experts working with the Chainlink team to help startups use Chainlink’s decentralized oracle tech to monetize APIs via smart contracts on the Oracle Blockchain Platform, the software giant’s “business-ready” distributed ledger.  Hundreds of thousands of clients could be reached through the initiative, as Ribeiro explained in his presentation:  Oracle Code One is the tech company’s developer conference, with this year’s event having a focus on “leading-edge technology such as blockchain, chatbots, microservices, and AI.” More will be known then, but Ribeiro pointed to startups like smartrips.co, Increff, and iGeolise as examples of partners already onboarding with Chainlink’s middleware. Notably, Ribeiro later added that the Oracle startups program would have an open-door policy toward prospects, with early participants being given free cloud credits, significant platform discounts, and unlimited support access to help Chainlink integrations: The development comes as Oracle has been ramping up its blockchain activities. Earlier this year, the tech company rolled out new capabilities for its Oracle Blockchain Platform, all of which centered around making it easier for enterprises to build dapps upon it. Arab Jordan Investment Bank and Nigeria Customs are among the entities currently using that platform to build applications. Oracle’s pivot to Chainlink marks the second time this month a major tech company has seriously eyed the network. The first example came just days ago, when developer advocate Allen Day released an article detailing how hybrid blockchain-cloud apps could be built that use Chainlink oracles to ping data from BigQuery, Google’s serverless data warehouse, to Ethereum. Day noted such a stack could be used to improve transaction privacy and prediction marketplaces, as well as to make blockchain-centric financial contracts via the Google Cloud Public Datasets Program, such as Ethereum gas price futures. As the advocate explained: As the cryptoeconomy has turned bullish in 2019, LINK has been among its strongest recent performers alongside bitcoin and Binance’s BNB token. Buy pressure around the token popped upward on June 25th as the Oracle news spread, with LINK rising to $2.41 USD before the presentation, before settling back down to around $2.17 as of this morning. The token, which incentivizes the Chainlink network, is now up 77 percent on the month, up 594 percent over the last six months, and up 1,117 percent on the year. Optimism has remained steady on the heels of Chainlink launching its mainnet on Ethereum in late May.",

        "passage": "If you were one of the world’s most influential companies and you wanted to introduce a cryptocurrency aimed at global domination in the digital payments arena … you might just name it GlobalCoin. That’s what social media titan Facebook has gone and done according to a May 24th report out of the BBC that has considerably advanced the amount of publicly known information around the company’s previously shrouded “Project Libra” crypto project.  For starters, it’s been revealed that Facebook has dubbed the token GlobalCoin in their in-house conversations. Whether that name will stick as the final one for the crypto remains to be seen, but it’s a possibility until the company announces otherwise. Moreover, it’s now known that Facebook is aiming to start GlobalCoin’s journey by launching it for users in approximately 12 countries at some point in the first quarter of 2020. That seemingly marks an expansion, insofar as the very earliest reporting around Facebook’s cryptocurrency project said it was being aimed for an initial pilot in India among WhatsApp users there. Another new revelation comes in the forms of who Facebook’s leadership has been reaching out to regarding the project. It was revealed earlier this month that the social media powerhouse had reached out to card titans Visa and Mastercard for potential support of the cryptocurrency. Courtesy of the new BBC report, we now also know that Facebook has also reached out to payments powerhouse Western Union seeking to help users interact with the coin with ease. Other stakeholders Facebook has since chatted with? One of the world’s most influential bankers, Bank of England’s Mark Carney, and one of the world’s most influential financial bodies, the U.S. Treasury. Those conversations respectively dealt with the possibilities of the coin and relevant regulatory matters. Notably, Facebook has apparently been designing GlobalCoin as a basketcoin — a token that is similar to a stablecoin, i.e. it mitigates price volatility concerns, but it works by being pegged to multiple assets instead of just one. There’s no word for now on what GlobalCoin’s multiple underpinning assets could be. Back in April, New York Times correspondent Nathaniel Popper noted that Facebook appeared to be seeking $1 billion USD in venture funding as collateral to back the basketcoin. Per Popper’s sources, Facebook’s leadership thought reaching out for outside funding was the best way to present the token going forward. As the NYT journalist said last month: Earlier this year, it was also reported that the social media company had already started reaching out to cryptocurrency exchanges about listing GlobalCoin, which is set to undergo its final tests in 2019. As Facebook’s GlobalCoin puts the company on course to compete with mainstream financial institutions like banks, the effort’s called for some further organizational configuring. That’s why Facebook registered Libra Networks, a subsidiary firm that will focus on fintech and blockchain solutions, in Switzerland this May. The entity will run the gamut when it comes to the kinds of services it will provide, as the firm’s registration said it will have an operational focus on “investing, payments, financing, identity management, analytics, big data, blockchain and other technologies.” Of course, when you’re an enterprise as sprawling and as pivotal as Facebook, you’ll always need to have your ducks in a row — particularly when U.S. congressman come calling. U.S. senators sent the company a letter on May 9th demanding answers on how it would approach privacy issues around its new cryptocurrency venture.",

        "passage": "On the one hand, Bitcoin continues to suffer its longest-running bear market, 414 days and counting as at the time of writing this article. However, reports indicate that more cryptocurrencies were stolen in 2018 than in other previous years. We asked Rafal Szymanski to give his expert opinion about this. Why is cryptocurrency theft on the increase when the prices are significantly lower than they were at the back end of 2017? Well, the answer could lie in the notion that centralized cybercrime syndicates are responsible for a large portion of such thefts; especially the ones concerning exchange platforms.  A January 2019 report published by CipherTrace, a blockchain analysis firm, revealed that cybercriminals stole about $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies throughout 2017. According to the report, crypto theft went up by 400 percent from the figures recorded in 2017. When the bear market struck, and Ether prices fell, many ICO projects suffered the consequences. With Ethereum being the de facto platform of choice for many of these projects, liquidity problems soon became a nagging issue. The Menlo-Park based CipherTrace reports that investors lost close to $750 million to exit scams in 2018. Last year also saw the emergence of criminal charges being brought against principal actors associated with scam ICOs. With the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies falling by more than 80 percent, it appears odd that more of it is being stolen. Not only is crypto theft on the rise, but experts say more cybercriminals are developing more elaborate means of achieving their aims. One of such growing threats is the emergence of carefully orchestrated inside jobs leading to the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition to hackers gaining unauthorized entry to crypto wallets, people working in cryptocurrency firms are allegedly collaborating to exploit investors. QuadrigaCX, a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange is currently in the news after the death of its CEO and the inability of the company to access close to $260 million held in cold storage. However, feelers from cryptocurrency forensic specialists say that the platform had no cold storage and that funds are domiciled in online exchange platforms. Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell corroborated seemed to corroborate these reports in a recent tweet. A 2019 report by Chainalysis revealed another dimension to the incessant cryptocurrency hacking incidents. According to the report, about 60 percent of all such attacks are the work of two cybercrime cartels. If the report is accurate, then those exchange hacks that leave hundreds of millions of dollars stolen are organized crimes. If so, it might explain why there is still an allure for such nefarious activities even in a bear market. According to Chainalysis, the two cartels which the report designated as “Alpha and Beta” have two different motives for their attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Alpha syndicate supposedly are anarchists, with the attacks merely serving as a prelude to more sinister goals. The Beta team, on the other hand, simply wants to make money.",

According to a press release, Lenovo will be using the Credits platform to develop Internet of Things (IoT) and VR/AR hybrid software. The new software is going to be aimed at numerous industries, including fintech, and logistics.  Credits’ Dapp platform has been increasing in popularity. According to the press release, Credits, “will utilize their blockchain expertise to help facilitate building software,” as a part of Lenovo’s New Vision Technology project. Lenovo sees IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and VR/AR as a major source of innovation in coming years. Credits CEO & founder Igor Chugunov thinks that: Credits’ platform will be used to aid internal operations, and help Lenovo manage their new venture into commercializing cutting edge technology. Credits has been a very popular company lately. Their blockchain platform is capable of performing up to one million transactions per second. Additionally, its offers a processing speed of 0.01 seconds and delivers rock-bottom commission rates as low as $0.001 USD. Credits’ smart-contracts allow users to set cycles and create payment schedules, all of which adds up to a formidable blockchain toolkit. The press release that announced their partnership with Lenovo expanded on Credits’ merits, Credits recently announced that they would be working with Nuggets, who wants to tap their fast and secure payments platform. Nuggets is a UK-based fintech start-up that is focused on e-commerce, and online ID. They entered into partnerships with Alipay and WeChat, which may create opportunities for their services in Asia. Nuggets CEO Alastair Johnson also seems to realize how important speed and low costs are for blockchain adoption, he commented after the partnership was made public. Credits has also cemented partnerships with other innovative start-ups like Quillhash and The TITA Project, which suggests that their blockchain platform is able to be deployed into various niche markets. Unlike some of the original blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Credits’ appears to be excelling in the commercial sphere. Despite all the hype surrounding blockchain, it looks like it is entering the marketplace faster than many anticipated. Although some successful investors have speculated that blockchain is in the midst of a bubble, the fact that numerous major companies are implementing blockchain-based platforms would suggest that blockchain is going to meaningfully impact global industry. Lenovo might be working towards rolling out a payments platform that will easily integrate with IoT technology, and using Credits’ infrastructure as a jumping off point for a new kind of integrated payments system. IoT could change the way that people use everyday technology, but it would have to circumvent the existing financial system. Numerous projects have been either proposed or patented over the last six months that would allow people to use IoT and micro-payments to control the way they use electricity. There are many other areas where blockchain, AI, micro-payments would allow breakthroughs in efficiency. Consumers now control more processing power than ever before. New platforms like VideoCoin seek to buy unused processing capacity to distribute video, and the potential for blockchain-based payments could unlock new ways for people to take full advantage of the computers that they own.  Read: Guide to VideoCoin Charges seems to have created a platform that can make ultra-low value payments feasible, which puts them into a good position to participate in the next generation of efficiency-oriented consumer technology.",

        "passage": "Galaxy Digital Holdings (GDH) was designed to be the first crypto merchant bank. Unfortunately for Mike Novogratz’s visionary project, falling crypto prices put a big hit of the value of GDH’s assets in Q1 this year. Mark-to-market losses for GDH’s crypto assets were in excess of $80 million USD, and actual trading losses helped to push total losses north of $130 million USD. Despite a terrible Q1, Mike Novogratz is optimistic. He had this to say in a statement after the financials for GDH were released: The $130 million USD loss that GDH sustained is substantial, as the bank’s assets were valued at around $280 million USD at the end of Q1. The vast majority of those assets are digital, which probably means cryptocurrencies or something similar. Mike Novogratz was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, and did very well during the massive rally over the last few years.  For the moment, GDH isn’t legally required to disclose their financials. Mike Novogratz has been talking about listing GDH on the TSX-V since last year, which would explain why GDH chose to release a pretty rough-looking financial statement. In order for GDH to list on the TSX-V, they have to disclose their financial position. If GDH is planning on going public via a reverse merger, they could be on the threshold of a new cycle of capital raising. Publicly traded companies usually have an easier time raising cash. With securities trading on the open market, GDH would be accessible to a much wider group of investors.  Mike Novogratz, Image from ToshiTimes The TSX-V has been a hotbed of crypto-related public listings. Last year saw the first ever listing of a Bitcoin miner, with HIVE Mining exploding in value. There have been a few more listings on the TSX-V this year. Hut-8 Mining is one of the more notable new listings, but none have created the returns that HIVE did when it hit a white-hot market last year. According to recent research, 2017 was an incredible year for returns in the crypto sector. The average crypto investment returned 136,000% during 2017, which is an amazingly high rate of return. In established markets a 10-15% return is very respectable, so the six digit percentage returns that cryptos delivered could be seen as overstretched. Last year Iota returned more than 600,000% to early investors, which is a staggeringly high rate of return. In most cases these companies are still revenue-negative, so much like the internet-bubble of the late 1990’s, some amount of caution is probably warranted in the sector. According to Mike Novogratz, widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies is still probably six or more years away. A recent poll discovered that only 2% of respondents in the US actually owned bitcoin, but this could be taken in numerous ways. For crypto bulls, the 2% figure could mean that there is a huge market waiting in the wings, but for the bears, it could just as easily be taken to mean that there is little public interest in the world’s most valuable crypto. The same poll showed that around 25% of the respondents were “intrigued” by Bitcoin. Given the returns that cryptos have produced in the last year or two, it would be nearly impossible for people to ignore the sector. Even with the ongoing downdraft in Bitcoin prices, it is still around 800% higher than it was when 2017 began. One of the biggest problems for the emerging crypto sector is the nature of a token. Unlike equity or debt, a token isn’t really ownership of anything. Owning a token is more or less the same thing as securing access to a blockchain, which isn’t something that fits into the established financial worldview. Many in the crypto sector have been waiting for the established financial system to invest in cryptos, but this may not be what pushes cryptos forward. The value that adoption and widespread use of cryptos could create is hard to imagine. As cryptos are really a form of tokenized access, it is possible that instead of price, adoption and use should be the first metrics that are looked at when the health of cryptocurrencies is examined.",

        "passage": "Popular encrypted messaging app Telegram is reportedly on the verge of publicly unveiling its planned cryptocurrency token, the Gram. According to a trio of Telegram investors who have spoken with The New York Times, the instant messenger company is aiming to release the first waves of Gram tokens by the end of October. The claims come after Telegram founder Pavel Durov said back in January that the TON network, the blockchain designed to underpin the Gram currency, was approximately 90 percent completed development-wise at the time.  Telegram had first announced its initial coin offering (ICO) for the project in January 2018. Within a few months, the social network had raised nearly $2 billion USD to build out the so-called Telegram Open Network. It was the second largest ICO in the space to date behind the EOS offering, which raised $4.2 billion during its run. According to a separate report from Russian media outlet Vedomosti, another investor said Telegram intends to open up public tests of Ton as of September 1st. The messenger powerhouse, which boasts more than 200 million users, envisions making the Gram the currency of choice within its own ecosystem. The company’s flagship app is already a mainstay among cryptocurrency communities of all sizes, and the ability to easily send digital currency within that app like a text message is likely to catch on with many users if everything proceeds according to plan. Of course, Telegram will have to continue navigating the regulatory implications of its new would-be global currency, like social media giant Facebook is currently facing with its proposed Libra stablecoin. Facebook has received a wave of regulatory attention over the project, and some think Telegram could be in store for a similar treatment. “I suspect that regulators will take a very close look at this offering,” cryptocurrency lawyer Richard Levin told NYT. One way or another, it looks like the TON network and its native Gram currency are getting closer to arrival. That mean these projects’ communities will have plenty of catching up to do when it comes to positioning themselves within the cryptoeconomy. The good news for them is some efforts are already being made on that front. For example, the decentralized exchange GramEth was presented as an ETHBerlin Hackathon project last week. As the builders of the DEX explained, it’s the “first-ever exchange that will allow making atomic swaps between TON and ETH.” If the project continues to be built out, then TON users will have another viable way to exchange their Gram tokens for ether and vice versa in the TON network’s fledgling days. Cosmos, Algorand, TON, and Filecoin. These are a few of the big-name “Layer 1” projects that are entering, or are angling toward, their adolescence. But in being new projects built in new ways, they are going to face novel challenges that earlier projects like Bitcoin didn’t have to endure. So explained Arianna Simpson, founder of venture capital firm Autonomous Partners, in a notable Twitter thread this week.  When Bitcoin first launched there were no incentives to attack it because it was essentially unknown, Simpson noted. But the opposite is true for larger cryptocurrency projects launching in 2019 and beyond. “There are 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars to be made by attacking top chains, and that # is rising,” she wrote.  Of course, these new projects’ builders are aware they’re launching into adversarial environments and are taking various precautions accordingly. But Simpson’s point is that the attack surfaces are way larger now, and malicious actors have more financial incentives to take advantage of those larger surfaces.",

        "passage": "ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees has criticized a published Wall Street Journal (WSJ) investigative article that purported the crypto exchange was used by criminals to launder money, which he claims are “inaccurate.” According to an official blog post, the CEO of the crypto exchange said the Wall Street Journal report showed a fundamental misinterpretation of how cryptocurrencies work and that the article’s claims were “factually inaccurate and deceptive.”  Explaining further, Voorhees said ShapeShift had been working with the Journal for nearly half a year, yet the article “omitted relevant information” and revealed that “the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of blockchain and our platform in particular.” On Friday, an article published by two reporters at the Wall Street Journal titled “How Dirty Money Disappears into the Black Hole of Cryptocurrency,” concluded that a sum of $88 million was laundered via 46 different exchanges in the space of two years—with ShapeShift being responsible for $9 million of the total amount laundered.  Read: Bitcoin & Money Laundering The preamble of the article stated: The article singled out ShapeShift and inferred that the digital asset platform encourages illegal transaction because the system doesn’t require user information until much recently. However, Voorhees fought back on the claims and argues that if indeed $9 million was laundered through ShapeShift, it would translate to only 0.15 percent of the exchange’s total transaction. Besides, the exchange has “a strong record of complying with law-enforcement requests, providing valuable assistance in over 30 investigations in 13 different countries all over the world.” He also added that users could not launder fiat currencies through the exchange, stating: Voorhees stated that the misinterpretation of how ShapeShift work may have led to some of the Journal’s conclusions. Citing an example of some funds that were transferred via a suspicious transaction to an exchange, which later sent funds to ShapeShift. Here’s what he wrote, Voorhees went on to explain how much transperancy means to the platform. According to him, ShapeShift is one of the most transparent exchanges operating today. Every transaction through the platform is published online, irrespective of the user privacy protections that it has maintained to date. He also stated the Journal leveraged on this information to carry out its investigation, adding that “perhaps the irony is lost on the WSJ, but the WSJ would have been unable to do this kind of investigation with any other crypto exchange because they aren’t transparent in this way.”",

        "passage": "The cryptoeconomy saw a series of stark selloffs across the board in 2018, and general rallies in its markets have been few and far between since then. Accordingly, traders perked up on Monday, February 18th, as the top 25 cryptocurrencies were all in the green on the day, several markedly so. Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency per market capitalization, seemed to lead the latest buy swell, its price having gained nine percent from $123 USD to $134 on Sunday while most other big-cap and mid-cap cryptocurrencies were still flat. As Monday arrived, the ether price took another 10 percent climb from $134 to a high above $148 while buy pressure began hitting the other top cryptocurrency markets.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose more than seven percent in the rally to reach $3900, a mark that’s within striking distance of the round and psychological $4,000 price point. The move up comes as the genesis cryptocurrency had settled amid sideways chop around $3,500 in recent weeks. Other popular assets fared just as well on the green day. Ripple’s XRP, Tron (TRX), and stellar lumens (XLM) all gained more than six percent respectively. The biggest rises among the top coins came from EOS (+22 percent), bitcoin cash (+19 percent), litecoin (+12 percent), and Cardano’s ADA (+12 percent). The top privacy coins, Monero and Zcash, each saw their prices rise more than eight percent. There have been acute daily rallies in the current cryptoeconomy bear market, which earlier this month became the longest in Bitcoin’s history to date. But what’s been lacking in the downturn is consecutive days of upward momentum. The sharp rise of the ether price two days in a row has some traders in the space wondering if the beginning of the end is nigh for the bearish market cycle. Bullish rumblings this February have price watchers wondering what comes next. On Feb. 8th, cryptocurrency markets saw their last rally with litecoin leading the way atop a 30 percent rise. That surge combined with the latest round of buy pressure may suggest that demand, whether it be retail or institutional demand, is materializing once more around the top digital assets. Fundstrat, the firm of high-profile Wall Street cryptocurrency analyst Tom Lee, thinks the page will be turning for the ecosystem this year. Fundstrat published its 2019 crypto outlook two weeks ago, and in it the firm projected the bear market would bottom out within the next several months. Of course, that estimation is a far cry from saying a bull run is imminent, and as always it’s anyone’s guess where cryptocurrency markets go from here, but the firm’s bottom call is another sign that optimism seems to be returning to the space after sentiments turned generally bleak in 2018. Even a modest recovery throughout the year would be welcomed by cryptocurrency diehards, as it’s now been more than 400 days since bitcoin peaked near $20,000 in December 2017. As such, any steps toward that mark will be championed by proponents in perpetuity. Unless, that is, the bitcoin price ever breaks through $20k again, at which their hopes of a return will have been borne out. But the cryptoeconomy isn’t out of the wood’s just yet. Concerns about the possibility of a global economic recession still linger around the world stage, and if such a recession were to occur, a de-risking investment atmosphere would reign supreme for the interim. Speculative assets like cryptocurrencies would likely be among the investment instruments hit hardest if global markets go down. For now, the only thing to do is wait and see what happens next.",

The global partnership agreement between People Capital and Xunlei was signed on July 22, 2018. It and was first disclosed at the China-US Entrepreneur and Investment Summit hosted by the People’s Daily Online in Silicon Valley, California.  Contained in the agreement signed by both parties is the plan to establish a laboratory for “technology innovation” and serving as a component of the People’s Capital Blockchain Research Institute. The collaboration of both entities will be geared towards exploring the application of blockchain technology to integrate its innovative system across different businesses. General Manager of the People’s Daily Ye Zhenzhen pointed to the “operating mechanism” as the most important part of the blockchain mechanism. He went further stating that “Through the ingenious combination of technologies, the fair distribution of resources is completed.” Poised to ensure blockchain is streamlined along with the services rendered by the People’s Daily Online which is the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CCP), the collaboration will also build a “high-level industrial service platform” to provide offline activities such as workshops, seminars, and application competitions.   Mr. Zhao Yahui, General Manager of People Capital and Mr. Lei Chen, Xunlei and Onething Technologies CEO, jointly announced the establishment of the blockchain foundational technology innovation laboratory. Image Source. Established in 1997, the People’s Daily Online is the online version of the People’s Daily, and it floats a multilingual internet presence with pages in Arabic, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and English. These pages provide news mainly about happenings in China but offer a less in-depth discourse on socio-political and economic analysis of China’s foreign policies and political trajectories. People’s Daily has often been regarded by many as the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party. The company enjoys the largesse of the government through tax allowances thereby giving it the leverage for expansion. The company was exempted from remitting taxes from 2010 to 2013 as part of concessions to ensure state-controlled cultural firms become real companies.  The online version in 2012 became modern China’s first listed media company on the country’s A-Share Market running an editorial business. Xunlei, a multinational technology company, and an online service provider, is one of the global leaders in the provision of blockchain infrastructures and services for companies in China and beyond. Founded in 2003, the company ranked as the most commonly used BitTorrent client in the world in 2010. Its peer-to-peer software and download manager supports HTTP, FTP, eDonkey and BitTorrent protocols. Last month, China’s oldest media publication covering news in the tech industry, Beijing Sci-Tech made known its plans to offer subscriptions payable with Bitcoin (BTC). The development was received with mixed reactions due to the government’s recent clampdown on crypto exchanges and Initial Coin Offerings which halted blockchain operations among many operators. Back in July, an audacious project worth $5 million was sponsored by blockchain platform ConsenSys to provide blockchain startup Civil Media Company with a platform where independent newsrooms can keep correspondence with their readers. These readers will have the privilege of possessing stakes in the form of cryptocurrency to support any publication they trust on the blockchain. The effort which is an innovation aimed at integrating journalism into the blockchain will give readers the right to vote for stories they deem ethical with their civil tokens. Civil launched its token (CVL) on September 28 in a fundraising event. The company promised not to relent on its oars until it creates a decentralized network for ethical journalism. 681 of its newsreaders have purchased their CVL token, and this amounted to $1,344,721.59. In February, Jason Goldberg of Simple Token (OST) partnered with photography platform Unsplash to tokenize billions of photo events and bringing blockchain to the mainstream of photo-journalism.",

Gary Cohn has Goldman Sachs on his resume, and more recently he worked at the White House, as an economic aide for the Trump administration. Now he is joining the board of advisers at Spring Labs, a Los Angles-based blockchain company. Mr. Cohn has been lying low since March of this year, when he decided to cut his relationship with Trump’s White House off. He had been opposed to President Trumps opening salvo in the ongoing global trade war, which looks good for him in retrospect. Spring Labs is working on blockchain-based solutions for consumer credit, which could be a massive market.  Spring Labs already has a number of prominent advisers, including Nigel Morris, who is the co-founder Capital One bank, and Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). Consumer credit is a staple of the US economy, and if Spring Labs is able to add value to the industry, it could be a great move for Gary Cohn. Gary Cohn seems to be amped about his new position, and the blockchain space. He said that, “I have been very interested in blockchain technology for a number of years, and Spring Labs is developing a network that could have profound implications for the financial services sector, among others,” and, “I am excited to actively support the Spring Labs team in the development of this important business and network,” via a press release. Spring Labs secured almost $15 million USD in financing earlier in 2018. The company sees blockchain’s ability to offer an extra level of data security as a huge benefit to the consumer credit market, which has been subject to numerous hacking attempts. Equifax is a similar company, minus the blockchain angle. They lost the data of nearly 150 million people last year, in a major hack that has been the source of controversy. Consumer credit information is incredibly valuable to hackers, and companies like Equifax are clearly unable to defend sensitive data from bad actors. Blockchain would give banks and credit providers a direct link with consumer credit information, and remove companies like Equifax from the equation. Despite the fact that people like Gary Cohn, Nigel Morris and Sheila Bair, among many others, see value in blockchain, there is still a vocal opposition to the technology. Nouriel Roubini was on the warpath again last week, this time during an informal hearing that was organized by US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The opinions that Mr. Roubini expressed haven’t changed much, and he still feels very negative on anything having to do with blockchain or cryptocurrency. He told the hearing that Bitcoin is, “the mother of all scams” and that blockchain is, “the most hyped technology ever.” There is no doubt a substantial amount of hype surrounding blockchain, which is totally normal for an innovative technology that could make major changes happen at many levels. Whenever a new technology comes along that shows great potential, no matter if it is a railroad, an automobile, or the internet, some amount of speculative fervor seems to grip the markets. Bubbles tend to occur, and many people back platforms and companies that simply won’t make it. Evidence of a speculative frenzy is actually proof of blockchain’s potential, and numerous people understand that it could be a new way to store data, regardless of the kind of blockchain architecture in question. Some of the biggest companies in the world are using blockchain, which is another indication of its future in global business. IBM and Walmart will be implementing a blockchain-based food tracking system over the next year, and many banks are patenting settlement systems that use blockchain. Major Asian banks are working with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to switch over the a blockchain powered trade finance platform, which was designed by Ping-An, and is in use currently in China.",

        "passage": "Big Four accounting firm EY is back in blockchain world headlines this week, this time for joining forces with some of Europe’s most recognizable institutions in having begun work on a blockchain platform for settlements involving European Commercial Papers (ECPs). Announced by the initiative’s members on Wednesday, the collaboration entails an already developed “proof of value” being built out. EY is linking up with Spanish commercial banking giant Banco Santander, the European Union’s lending institution the European Investment Bank (EIB), and Belgian financial services company Euroclear in the effort.  The group’s express goal? to create an “end-to-end blockchain solution for the issuance and settlement” of ECPs. Also known as eurocommercial papers, ECPs are unsecured debt instruments denominated in a different currency than the reigning currency of its issuer’s country. And now the major European institutions involved have concluded they can make the markets around these instruments considerably more efficient via blockchain technology. The aforementioned proof of value grew out of a proof of concept that EY’s coders rode to victory during the EIB Blockchain Challenge last June. The PoC entailed leveraging blockchain tech to streamline issuances and exchanges between the EIB and the institution’s counterparties. The matured platform is set to reduce wait times and transaction costs, providing superior auditability around ECP operations all the while. The system’s designer, EY Senior Manager Angel Pavlov, suggested the solution was one well worth pursuing: For their part, EY’s latest foray into blockchain comes on the heels of the firm recently becoming something of a darling in the cryptoeconomy. That’s because the accounting powerhouse released their Nightfall privacy tool for Ethereum into the public domain last month. The company, whose blockchain team is comprised of some 200 developers, built the tool as a way for large enterprises to be able to transact on the public Ethereum blockchain while ensuring their transaction details would remain private. The tech uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to achieve such privacy. Many corners of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particurarly the Ethereum community, saw the tool’s release as a goodwill gift to the cause of digital currencies. EY characterized the publication as a way to get enterprises using blockchain solutions more readily. PwC, another member of the so-called Big Four accounting firms alongside EY, announced on Wednesday the company had added cryptocurrency auditing capabilities to its Halo auditing tool suite. Accordingly, Halo users can now access the suite’s “assurance services” for activity around bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), Ethereum tokens (ERC20), litecoin (LTC), and XRP. The solution also supports analyzing the blockchains of smaller Bitcoin forks in Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG). Part of these services will allow clients to analyze private-public key pairings so as to help “establish ownership of cryptocurrency,” the company explained. Commenting on the news, PwC Global Assurance Leader James Chalmers cast the cryptocurrency update as a response to the general trend of digitization, as more of society’s activities — including money — is going online: One thing’s clear enough, then: with PwC and EY increasingly zooming in, some of the world’s biggest money minders are seriously eyeing blockchain and cryptocurrency tech.",

        "passage": "As the specter of cryptocurrencies grows in regulatory circles across the globe, some policymakers are taking steps to go to war with anonymous cryptocurrency use. Their aim? To stem the tide of assets that can power commerce outside of the state’s purview. The latest flex against anonymous and psuedonymous cryptocurrency use comes from Texas, where State Representative Phil Stephenson has introduced a draft bill that, if passed by the Texas legislature and signed into law by the state governor, would stringently mandate the deanonymization of Texan crypto users.  The unprecedented bill, H.B. No. 4371, is tentatively titled as “relating to digital currencies.” The legislation would enforce that all enterprises in the state validate the identity of customers paying via cryptocurrency.  Alternatively, identities need not be validated if customers pay with a so-called verified identity digital currency (VIDC). One relevant portion of the bill, Sec. 662.0002, reads: Per Rep. Stephenson’s definition of terms, a VIDC would be a “digital currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known before a person has access to another person’s digital wallet.” General Counsel for Athena Blockchain and NYU professor Drew Hinkes noted on Twitter that it’s unclear if any cryptocurrencies would presently qualify as VIDCs per H.B. 4371. Hinkes also threw into question what amount or kinds of identification would satisfy the draft bill’s requirements.  In that same thread, Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research at non-profit cryptocurrency research and advocacy group Coin Center, said the bill was “very oddly drafted” and suggested its language betrayed a lack of understanding in “how digital currencies work.”  For now, it’s too early in the process to have any indication as to whether H.B. 4371 will pass or not. But its introduction is notable insofar as it marks the first time a bill of its thrust has been put forward in any of the 50 U.S. states. Only time will tell if legislators in other parts of the country follow suit in putting forward similar bills. Rumblings of a privacy-focused crackdown in France’s nook of the cryptoeconomy have taken shape over the last few weeks after the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, the country’s lower parliamentary house, issued a report in which the body said a ban on anonymizing cryptocurrencies had been worth considering. “It would […] have been appropriate to propose a ban on the dissemination and trade in [privacy coins that] ensure complete anonymity by preventing any identification procedure by design,” the committee president said. The report hailed privacy coin stalwarts like Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), and PIVX as likely candidates for such a ban. Like H.B. 4371, though, it remains to be seen whether the committee’s suggestion will lead to any further policy traction in the Western European powerhouse. The Texas draft bill is something of an outlier, as a handful of American states have recently been taking pro-crypto legislative strides to accommodate, not crackdown, on the cryptoeconomy. Arguably the most high-profile of these states has been Wyoming, which has moved forward on more than a dozen crypto-friendly bills this year.  Other states like Utah, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Arizona have also seen fresh permissive approaches to cryptocurrencies as of late. Since there have been no federal crypto laws passed in the U.S. so far, states have necessarily had to take the lead toward the ecosystem, and some are doing so much more liberally than others.",

        "passage": "The wait is over: Bakkt’s bitcoin futures are being launched next month. The cryptoeconomy has been captivated with all things Bakkt ever since Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner-operators of the NYSE and other major financial markets, announced back in August 2018 that it was launching the cryptocurrency exchange and physically-settled bitcoin futures products. In the past year, Bakkt’s repeatedly pushed those plans back in order to get things right and not rush its rollout. But the final stretch is in, company chief executive officer Kelly Loeffler revealed in an August 16th blog post. Therein, Loeffler confirmed the firm has achieved the needed steps to launch its bitcoin futures on September 23rd.  The announcement comes on the same day that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — separately infamous in the cryptoeconomy for creating the BitLicense — granted Bakkt a banking charter to operate the Bakkt Trust Company in the state. That trust company will serve as the qualified custodian for the Bakkt Warehouse, where Bakkt will safely store the bitcoin that underpin its physically-delivered futures products. There will be two such contracts to start, one of which will track the bitcoin price monthly and the other daily. The futures themselves will be traded on the ICE Futures US platform and settled on ICE Clear US. “This offers customers unprecedented regulatory clarity and security alongside a regulated, globally accessible exchange in a market underserved by institutional-grade infrastructure,” Loeffler said on Friday. Recent developments indicated it was only a matter of time until Bakkt launched. The firm started user acceptance testing back in July. And ICE’s leadership noted even more recently that Bakkt was on the verge of being a-go. “Subject to final regulatory approvals, we plan to launch our physically settled bitcoin futures in the very near future,” ICE CEO Jeffrey Sprecher had said during an August 1st earnings call. Back in the spring, reports swirled that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had qualms over how Bakkt was planning to custody bitcoin for its futures products. The Commission allegedly wanted Bakkt to optimize its custody plans further. In the time since then, it appears Bakkt did just that. The CFTC hasn’t pressed the issue and later accepted Bakkt’s self-certification process. But the CFTC certainly won’t hesitate to apply pressure if it feels it needs to. Consider the recent case of LedgerX. The company’s leadership announced it rolled out a physically-delivered bitcoin futures product to U.S. users on July 31st. However, that didn’t end up being the case. Over the span of the next day, the CFTC told LedgerX to censor its tweets associated with that botched launch because the firm “has not yet been approved by the Commission,” CFTC chief communications officer Michael Short later noted to CoinDesk. Things got tenser from there, as LedgerX CEO Paul Chou floated the idea of suing the Commission for “breach of duty,” among other things. The company’s press representative at the time also resigned. If LedgerX had successfully brought its physically-delivered bitcoin futures to market on July 31st, it would’ve beat Bakkt and other companies like ErisX to the punch. We’ve seen bitcoin futures before from CME Group and Cboe, but these have been cash-settled products. Bakkt’s physically-settled bitcoin futures could be a game changer for demand around bitcoin, as BTC will need to be purchased and sent to the owner upon a contract’s completion. As these contracts will be taking place daily and monthly, buy pressure around bitcoin could see a boon on September 23rd and beyond. And with LedgerX and ErisX seemingly not far behind, things are set to get more and more institutional around the OG cryptocurrency in the months ahead.",

        "passage": "The Russian Duma is considering a new Ruble-based stablecoin. According to reports from Russian radio news station Govorit Moskva, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets announced that the Russian government will likely press forward with a national cryptocurrency. Anatoly Aksakov told a press conference that the Duma is working on a plan for a Russian cryptocurrency, “but it will be a ruble-pegged cryptocurrency.” Instead of creating a new currency that would compete directly with other cryptos, the ‘Crypto Ruble’ would be pegged at 1:1 to the fiat ruble.  This announcement marks the first movement from a major government on the topic of a national crypto, which could be used by the general public. It could also be part of a bigger banking shift in Russia. For now, the Crypto Ruble is still just an idea, but it seems like more progress is being made by Russian lawmakers all the time. The plan that chairman Anatoly Aksakov described appears to be in line with other stablecoins like Tether. Unlike a private stablecoin that relies on a bank account filled with fiat currency, the Russian plan seems to be a little bit different. An individual would be able to open a normal ruble account, and then have them ‘turned into’ Crypto Rubles. The exact mechanism was not discussed at the press conference, but the Crypto Ruble would likely be based in blockchain. While this state-basked stablecoin probably not what crypto purists were hoping for, national stablecoins could spread the use of cryptos among people that aren’t comfortable with using cryptos like bitcoin.  Read: National Cryptocurrencies: Russian Cryptoruble, Venezuelan Petro and Estonian Estcoin In addition to being backed by a fiat currency, the Crypto Ruble would probably be accepted by other nations that have friendly relationships with Russia. At the moment there are numerous shifts happening in the Eurasian political environment, and this new program could be a part of a wider strategy from Moscow. The Venezuelan Petro is pretty much a joke, as no one in their right mind wants anything to do with Venezuela or its currency. Russia has been the target of sanctions that originate in the USA, but they have an economy that supplies a tremendous amount of fossil fuels to both Europe and China. The Crypto Ruble probably wouldn’t be put into the same class as the Petro, as Russia does business with some of the largest economies on earth. Russia also has a number of currency swap agreements with numerous trading partners, which would make establishing ruble accounts simple. Once a foreign currency has been swapped for rubles, it seems that Crypto Rubles would be a logical next step for trading partners who were willing to deal in them. Russia has been far more resilient to the US-led sanctions that many thought possible. As part of the sanctions, Russia was cut off from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers. Instead of bow to international pressure, Russia designed their own international money transfer platform. Chairman Aksakov told reporters that “Our domestic system (called SPFS) for the transfer of financial messages already has more users that SWIFT has. Talks with China, Iran, Turkey and a number of other countries are currently underway in order to coordinate our system with their systems. It is important to coordinate them technologically in order to avoid problems with domestic systems for transfer of financial messages,” at a press conference in Moscow last Thursday. A national cryptocurrency would make international transfers even easier for Russia to facilitate. The USA has been in a position of financial power for many decades, but now it looks like realistic alternatives to the established system are nearing readiness. The Crypto Ruble could be a big part of a new global payments system and would give Russia an advantage if their relationship with the USA continues to worsen.",

        "passage": "This week, Enjin Coin, a modular blockchain platform centered around tokenized gaming, hit the limelight and saw its ENJ cryptocurrency price acutely surge after reporting indicated, and the project’s leadership confirmed, the Ethereum-based coin play had entered a partnership with international smartphone manufacturing titan Samsung Electronics. After Samsung announced its crypto-friendly Galaxy S10 smartphone last month, chatter swelled that the phone’s in-built Samsung Blockchain Keystore would support ether (ETH) and ERC20 tokens in the very least. A reveal picture of the Keystore had shown in-app mock holdings of ETH, ENJ, and Basic Attention Token (BAT).  However, Enjin Coin has garnered much more than ERC20 support on the S10, as Enjin’s Vice President of Marketing Simon Kertonegoro later confirmed his team’s partnership with one of Samsung’s biggest arms. Kertonegoro told CoinDesk. Specifics on the collaboration are nonexistent for now, then, other than both partners are based out of South Korea and that smartphone tech is all but certain to be central in the team-up. The hearty adoption news led to investors acutely piling into ENJ, lifting the cryptocurrency into the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and pushing the ENJ price up nearly 80 percent on the day.  In a since deleted tweet, even Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao got in on the clamor. In responding to popular cryptocurrency pundit Boxmining’s comments above, Zhao said, “Congrats to ENJ, solid tech wins.” In the wake of the partnership’s revelation, Boxmining has been closely tracking rumors and leaks around the ENJ and Samsung mesh and has highlighted how purported images of the S10 show direct support for ENJ and the project’s ERC1155 gaming token standard.  A fruitful prospect for token platforms is non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or assets that leverage digital scarcity. And the ability of NFTs to foster new kinds of digital commerce is often put forward as an example of how cryptocurrencies can add novel and innovative dimensions to the booming gaming industry. The Enjin program, then? To streamline tokenization in gaming by making it easier and more efficient to create NFTs than existing ERC standards allow for. In this context, Samsung’s apparent embrace of Enjin isn’t necessarily surprising. The eSports scene has exploded in South Korea and beyond in recent years. In collaborating with Enjin, Samsung has positioned itself to make penetrations into the cryptocurrency and gaming markets, both of which could see further explosive growth yet over the next few decades. When the cryptoeconomy reached its peak bleakness in 2018, even major and positive news stories didn’t seem to move crypto prices up, if at all. Things have looked a little bit different in 2019, though, as a few alts have seen some recent momentum — enough momentum to have more traders wondering if the bearish cryptoeconomy is beginning to turn bullish. Some of the bigger movers so far this year have been litecoin (LTC) and Binance Coin (BNB). Smaller projects that have done well more recently have been ENJ and ChainLink (LINK), a decentralized oracle middleware project. Whether these price runs are just blips amid a wider bear market remains to be seen, however.",

        "passage": "The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently released a paper called, “Building Block(chain)s for a Better Planet.” The research paper was authored in conjunction with PWC and Stanford University’s Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. It is an overwhelmingly positive piece for blockchain, and proposes numerous areas where blockchain could make a big difference.  According to the report, Perhaps the most interesting idea that is contained in the above statement is the idea of “non-financial value.” In many ways, modern culture has become laser-focused on making money, while the nature (the underlying value) of money has been all but forgotten. While rather dryly written, the report raises some environmental issues that don’t often come up too often in the press. Blockchain does have the ability to reduce inefficiencies, which can also be a big benefit to our global ecosystem. The report goes on to say that, “Even though we have experienced a very positive economic growth (real output grew 20 times and 700 million people have shifted into the middle class), this has happened at the expense of our natural environment; pursuing economic growth, and thus demand, is putting increasing pressure on our environment,” which is a fair point to make. There has been a lot of hype surrounding blockchain. The word ‘blockchain’ was nearly synonymous with cryptos until recently when people started to wake up to the capabilities that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has. The WEF report seems to fade the smoke and mirrors that many are caught up in, and drives to the underlying potential that blockchain brings to numerous areas of commerce. The WEF cited the energy sector and utilities as a great place for blockchain applications. Of the hundreds of ICOs that came to the market last year, less than 1% of them involved energy or utilities. The WEF report identified 65 use cases for blockchain, and many of them fall into the energy sector. The WEF identified 8 areas where blockchain could become a stand-out technology. Here are four of them, all of which could lead to new businesses that create real social value for everyone involved. The WEF might be a little late to the blockchain party in the logistics sector. They see blockchain as ushering in a new era in how global supply chains function, which falls into line with the platforms that companies like IBM are rolling out in the real world right now.  Read: Blockchain & Supply Chain Management A centralized resource distribution model was the best we could do. In a world where coal or natural gas was the backbone of the electrical grid, centralized distribution by sophisticated parties probably was the best way to go. Now that non-traditional power systems are viable, it is probably time to make some changes to how we allocate energy. The financial system is long overdue for a major overhaul. Blockchain is seemingly tailor-made for microfinance and microlending, which could change the way people access capital everywhere. Instead of green power providers competing for loans at prevailing market rates, blockchain could allow people to lend on favourable terms to companies they want to support. Guess what? When you buy a product that is sold in a plastic container, you aren’t paying a realistic amount of money. There are a number of reasons for this, but the massive tax breaks that oil companies receive are one of them. There is little incentive to recycle most plastic products, which is why there is an enormous amount of plastic floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Blockchain is already being used by IBM to incentivize the collection of the Pacific’s garbage patch, and there are many other areas that could be helped by the same technology.",

        "passage": "With a growing influx of optimism, hype, and the next wave of newcomers in the cryptoeconomy, markets around cryptocurrencies are heating up. On Friday, the bitcoin price ended the week by bursting through $10,000 USD, rising by around $700 USD intraday according to Messari as it settled around $10,150 for the evening. BTC has since gone on to reach a high of $10,800, just $200 short of our Analyst, Nikola Lazic’s prediction yesterday. Notably, the June 21st spike has powered BTC to its best price so far in 2019, putting “digital gold” up 60 percent since this point last year. The genesis cryptocurrency is now up 156 percent over the last three months and up a whopping 1,593 percent over the last five years. Above $10,000, bitcoin is approximately halfway to its December 2017 all-time price high of $20,000.  The acute rally is, of course, only the latest nail in the coffin against naysayers’ arguments that bitcoin would descend into obscurity or even worthlessness after the 2018 cryptoeconomy bear market reared its head. Likely driving the uptrend is Libra, the cryptocurrency that social media giant Facebook formally announced earlier this week. As debate has exploded around Libra in both crypto and mainstream circles, Bitcoin has naturally been brought to the fore as the biggest blockchain with the biggest native cryptocurrency. There are those, like Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, who think FOMO — “fear on missing out” purchases — will boost the bitcoin price up to $15,000 in short order if buy pressure can keep bitcoin past the $10,000 mark decisively in the coming days.  That’s a very optimistic projection, to be sure, but such rapid movement wouldn’t be unprecedented. When bitcoin first hit $10,000 in November 2017, it took less than two weeks for FOMO to nudge the cryptocurrency’s price past $15,000. There’s no telling if that same trajectory will play itself out once more in 2019, but it’s certainly possible with the latest Bitcoin halvening now just months away and the realized capitalization of BTC recently suggesting a bull run was in its early stages.  In any case, Bitcoin has been the beneficiary of several intriguing 2019 headlines. So far this year, Microsoft has announced work on a decentralized identity (DID) tool that will be underpinned by Bitcoin, while mesh networkers GoTenna have spun off a subsidiary to actualize decentralized comms powered by bitcoin micropayments. On the enterprise front, forthcoming cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt — which is owned by New York Stock Exchange owner-operators ICE — is preparing to test its much-hyped bitcoin futures product this July. As for CME Group, their bitcoin futures offering set new records in May. Zooming out, the technical horizon seems to be coming together for Bitcoin too, as its proposed second-layer scaling, the Lightning Network, is maturing all the while. Ether, the figurative fuel of the Ethereum network, also spiked on Friday to its highest price yet this year. The ether (ETH) price spiked more than 10 percent on the day, pushing the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap up as high as $305, where its price hovered for a while. That still puts ether down 39 percent since this time last year and down 79 percent from its all-time high ($1,431), though the crypto is up 117 percent over the last quarter. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has been enjoying plenty of positive headlines as of late. For example, Cloud networking powerhouse Cloudfare just created its own Ethereum Gateway, only days after the Google Cloud team showed how Ethereum could be used to make hybrid “blockchain-cloud” apps. In the mean time, major firms like JP Morgan and EY are building out Ethereum tools. The smart contract platform is on the verge of evolving to its next stage, too. Ethereum’s builders are eyeing January 3rd, 2020, as a target date for launching the ETH 2.0 genesis block.",

        "passage": "The cryptocurrency derivatives arena just got its next big contender with the arrival of ErisX, which announced the opening of its crypto spot markets platform on April 30th. The Chicago-based exchange, which boasts major financial backers in mainstream heavyweights like TD Ameritrade and Cboe Global Markets Inc., was first created in 2010 to facilitate traditional cash-settled swap futures. The exchange’s leadership decided to pivot to crypto derivatives in late 2017 and announced last fall that their initial spot contracts offerings would be live by the end of Q2 2019 — a timeline the company has now made good on. A spot contract sets a buy or sell order for an asset, in ErisX’s case cryptocurrencies, which is then settled immediately on a specified date.  Commenting on the launch, ErisX chief operating officer Thomas Chippas hailed the crypto spot operations as only the beginning of the company’s coming journey: ErisX had first declared last year that it was looking to launch physically-settled crypto futures by the end of 2019. The exchange confirmed in their latest announcement that, if greenlighted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), those plans were still on and would entail the marketplace building out both a “regulated futures exchange and [a] clearinghouse.” Of course, ErisX would like to keep to their planned timeline, but the CFTC will accordingly want to be fully confident in the exchange’s operations before granting the requisite approvals. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Commission had yet to approve Bakkt’s own plans for physically-settled bitcoin futures over concerns with the forthcoming exchange’s custody plans. That reality apparently led to Bakkt’s powerhouse backers, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., acquiring crypto custodians Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC). So whether ErisX’s crypto futures will also be temporarily held up by the CFTC remains to be seen. But what is clear is that some major finance players have long been keen on the platform’s product arrivals. When TD Ameritrade first declared their investment into ErisX in 2018, the firm’s futures and foreign exchange managing director J.B. Mackenzie suggested the upstart exchange could eventually offer products like litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH) futures. He said: Amid its crypto spot market opening, the fledgling crypto derivatives platform also announced it had concluded its latest fundraising round, the third in its Series B so far. Participants in the current round included previous ErisX backers like Cboe, Nasdaq Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Ethereum venture capital studio ConsenSys. New investors included Flow Traders and New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG). As part of the deal, NYDIG chief financial and chief operating officer Rob Flatley has joined the ErisX Board of Directors. On the news, Flatley said: So, while ErisX still has a ways to go before it can achieve dominance in its market, the exchange and its supporters are angling to make such dominance closer to a guarantee than a bet.",

        "passage": "The crypto market may be depressed, but the underlying industry is as dynamic as ever. Reports indicate that as Twitch, an Amazon-owned video streaming service, silently removed users’ ability to make subscriptions with Bitcoin, a legendary player in the online privacy space opened its arms to accept an array of digital assets.  Not 48 hours ago, Redditors on the BTC forum claimed that Twitch removed support for payments made through BitPay, purported the crypto industry’s longest standing firm. While it isn’t clear when the content sharing platform added the feature, the forum-goer that drew attention to this issue claimed that Twitch removed BitPay support “in the last couple of weeks for all countries.” From Blockonomi’s glance of the Twitch subscription portal, BitPay is not a listed payment option, nor is Coinbase or direct Bitcoin payments, which the company claimed to have added at the peak of the previous rally. While this recent change flew under the radar, one user with the moniker “1John8Lare” took drastic action. The Twitch viewer “took action” by canceling all his subscriptions, slightly hurting streamers’ revenue, and sending Twitch’s support staff a ticket. It isn’t clear if other vigilantes took John’s lead, but it seems that many cryptocurrency users expressed disdain towards such a move, deemed an attempt to demonetize and deplatform content creators by some conspiracists. In stark contrast to the centralized Twitch, Tor, the de-facto go-to privacy- and anonymity-centric browser provider, has unveiled a donation jar that accepts cryptocurrencies. Tor’s website now accepts payments in nine leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, Monero, ZCash, and Augur. Interestingly though, users may contact Tor’s staffers if they intend to donate other digital assets that aren’t listed. The page purportedly encourages crypto philanthropists, many of which frequent the open-source Tor Browser and what it gives access to, to stand up for “universal rights to privacy and freedom” by keeping Tor’s products up-to-date. Sure, Twitch’s sudden removal of support for digital asset payments is a slight blow to the ecosystem, but arguably, adoption is booming. Just last week, Avnet, one of the world’s most prominent electronic components distributor, revealed it had integrated a payment portal from the Atlanta-based BitPay. In an announcement, the American technology company, a part of the Fortune 500, revealed that it would be accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash for its offerings. Avnet’s team sees cryptocurrencies as a step above traditional rails, as a company release argued that such assets can reduce the “time, cost and complexities of bringing products to market.” This is, of course, far from Apple, let’s say, accepting Bitcoin. But the move has been appreciated by the crypto community nonetheless. But, such acceptance may be just on the horizon. Two weeks back, Blockonomi reported that The Block’s sources have revealed that Starbucks is assumably on the verge of accepting Bitcoin payments through Bakkt’s infrastructure. The insiders tell the outlet that the world-renowned coffee roastery’s “mutually beneficial” partnership with Bakkt stipulates that it will accept the leading cryptocurrency within the next 12 to 18 months. Considering the legitimacy of The Block’s source, a food chain with thousands of locations across the globe may be on the verge of delving into Bitcoin. And with Square doubling down on its involvement in this space, with its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, unveiling a crypto-only branch that will hire five, many are sure that cryptocurrencies are far from dead in the water. But the pressing question remains: how fast will widespread adoption really occur?",

        "passage": "Cryptopia, a New Zealand-based cryptocurrency exchange, has not had the best start to 2019. As per the hack it experienced last month, which resulted in a multi-million dollar token heist, New Zealand police initiated an investigation of their to own ascertain whether or not the platform could have prevented the hack, or worse, was someway involved. However, it has now been reported that New Zealand Police have given Cryptopia the all clear to resume trading activities. Whilst New Zealand Police have also indicated that they are still engaged in the final stages of their investigation, this should indicate at the very least that Cryptopia themselves were not involved in any internal malpractice. It is important to note that whilst New Zealand authorities have given the green light for Cryptopia to re-open, it remains to be seen when or if the platform will decide to proceed.  Whilst it was New Zealand Police that initially took on the case, this was eventually passed on to the High Tech Crime Group. According to Detective Inspector Greg Murton, who spoke with the New Zealand Herald, the investigatory unit have “Finished the main part of the work required by the High Tech Crime Group at Cryptopia’s business premises, although HTCG staff remain there finishing up aspects of their work”. Murton continued to clarify that the final stages of the investigation are not preventing the exchange from re-opening their doors to the public. Interestingly, when Murton was asked whether or not the team responsible for running the exchange were likely to have criminal charges put against them, the detective refused to comment. For those looking for clarity on the specific amount stolen, as well as the underlying mechanism that allowed the hackers to succeed in their criminal endeavors, this still remains unclear. At the time of writing, the general consensus within the industry is that the amount stolen amounted to $16 million worth of cryptocurrency tokens, or $25 million New Zealand Dollars. This figure was initially brought forward by a blockchain analysis firm called Elementus. Through the use of an Ethereum blockchain analysis tool used by the research firm, Elementus believe that $16 million worth of Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens were stolen. However, as the analysis engine only covers tokens that run on the Ethereum blockchain, the researchers at Elementus argue that the total amount may in fact be higher. Whilst Cryptopia director Pete Dawson would not confirm the exact amount that was stolen from their internal servers, he did state that the figures being reported by the media were misinterpreted. Moreover, Cryptopia founders Rob Dawson and Adam Clarke have also failed to notify the public of the exact amount that was stolen, which, taking in to account that the hack happened just over a month ago, is somewhat surprising. We are also yet to ascertain what policy the team at Cryptopia are going to implement with respect to lost customer funds, if any at all. Whilst it remains to be seen whether or not the exchange will decide to re-open its doors now that it has the green light from New Zealand authorities, it also remains unclear as to what affect this will have on Cryptopia’s customer base. Although various exchanges that have previously been accustomed to an external hack and since recovered, research suggests that this has been in direct response to a customer re-payment plan for those that have had funds stolen.",

        "passage": "From many perspectives, Bitcoin may seem to have no function in today’s economy. Yes, it can be spent. But as Samson Mow of Bitcoin development studio, Blockstream, has stated, the base layer of the BTC blockchain isn’t exactly ready to support the world’s demands of a global medium of exchange. Transactions can take upwards of twenty minutes, can cost more than $0.5, and are technically public and can be tied back to your identity without the proper payment solutions.  But, data is showing that Bitcoin is finding a real-world use case in countries where corruption is suspected to be quite high. And this — using Bitcoin to stave off overreaching governments — is really the use case that long-time cryptocurrency proponents believe was what Satoshi Nakamoto was going for when he brought Bitcoin into the world. Bitcoin is a global trend. People from all over the world, barring that they don’t have access to the Internet, can use the cryptocurrency and its respective blockchain without a financial cost or a know-your-customer procedure. If you want to use Bitcoin, all you have to do is download an app. Getting the coins themselves, however, is a bit of a different story. While anyone can mine BTC or access a wallet, exchanges where you can purchase the cryptocurrencies may require you to have a bank account and government identification. Although this is no problem for someone in a democratic country like the U.S., working with exchanges in some of the less-developed and corrupt areas of the world may prove to be an issue. In these states, not only may you not have an I.D. or bank account but using an exchange may be illegal or frowned upon. Enter Local Bitcoins, a platform that promotes the peer-to-peer exchange of Bitcoin and fiat currency in a manner that is less regulatory stringent than, say, Coinbase or Bitstamp. According to data published by a user on Twitter, there is a clear correlation between a country’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the share of GDP (a measure of an economy’s size) that Local Bitcoins volume makes up. The correlation: the more corruption there is in a country’s government, the bigger role Local Bitcoins (and thus cryptocurrency) takes in its economy. Venezuela, which sported a CPI of 18 (one of the lowest in the world) in 2018, has a Local Bitcoins market that made up 0.2326% of its 2018 GDP. Venezuela is followed by Nigeria, Russia, Colombia, Ukraine, Kenya, Peru, and South Africa — all nations with relatively low CPI’s, according to Transparency.org.  This correlation is accentuating that in places where corruption, financial turmoil, and political debacles are rampant, Bitcoin is finding bona fide use. Alright, so now that we can see that a country’s level of governmental corruption is tied to the usage of Local Bitcoins, what are the oppressed using Bitcoin for? Is BTC a capital hedge/store of value or an alternative currency free from control to them? Well, it’s often a mix of both. Venezuela is a perfect example of a place in which Bitcoin serves two, maybe even three, primary functions. In the South American country, there are strict capital controls and there is rampant hyperinflation. You can find stories online of Venezuelans converting their bolivars to cryptocurrency instantly to protect their wealth, to buy goods without oversight and in a devaluing currency, and to move money across borders without governmental oversight and restrictions. So while Bitcoin may not be ready for use in the U.S. as a medium of exchange, have no doubt that it is helping those being oppressed by governments the world over.",

        "passage": "Retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp has announced it will be investing in a new cryptocurrency exchange known as ErisX to offer its clients cryptocurrency options other than bitcoin. This is further proof that cryptocurrencies are edging their way deeper into mainstream territory.  Steve Quirk – executive vice-president of trading & education at TD Ameritrade – explained in a statement: It’s getting harder to blur the lines between traditional financial investments and cryptocurrencies. Many hedge funds are now bitcoin or cryptocurrency-based, with nearly 100 new ventures opening their doors for business this year alone. Additionally, we’ve seen the introduction of both bitcoin and Ethereum-based futures contracts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has entered the long and arduous road of examining a bitcoin ETF proposal submitted by the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. This is the company’s third attempt to get such an ETF approved, and the first time where their application is being taken seriously. While the decision regarding whether to approve the ETF or not was originally set for September 30, the organization has announced that things will be postponed until late December, so they can garner further information and data from industry professionals. This is good news in the sense that the SEC is taking the time to fully understand the situation. They are giving it plenty of thought and aren’t saying “no” outright. Many analysts believe that out of all the bitcoin ETF proposals, the VanEck SolidX bitcoin ETF has the highest chance for approval. Other ETFs involve more mainstream assets such as copper, so the fact that the organization is giving it this much time is a huge step in the right direction. Managing director of futures and forex at TD Ameritrade JB Mackenzie comments: ErisX says it plans to offer spot trading to its customers by early 2019 granted it earns the appropriate regulatory approval. At press time, the amount of funds TD Ameritrade is investing in ErisX has not been revealed, though it joins many other investors – including Virtu Financial Inc, the Digital Currency Group and CBOE Global Markets Inc. – in contributing to the current funding round. CEO of ErisX Thomas Chippas explains: Founded over 40 years ago in 1975, TD Ameritrade provides both education and investing services to more than 10 million registered clients and holds more than $1.2 trillion in assets. It also offers custodial services to more than 6,000 separate accounts. The company executes nearly 800,000 trades each day and boasts a long history of innovation in the financial space. The company boasts over 10,000 employees, and often provides one-on-one client care to ensure customers understand the most probable investing routes available.",

The three companies have donated a combined total of $20 million to the platform through a Series A funding round and are looking to bring cryptocurrency trading to the masses.  KuCoin CEO Michael Gan commented: Each partner has certain strengths it will bring to the table. For example, IDG Capital boasts marketing power, while Matrix Partners brings resources and support and Neo has invested in several early (and promising) blockchain projects. KuCoin is also one of the most advanced trading platforms in the cryptocurrency space and serves over five million registered customers daily. The partnership will focus on specific aspects designed to ensure KuCoin’s growth and continued market access. The first is bringing KuCoin 2.0 to life. Expected to go live in Q1 of 2019, the platform is based on information and feedback executives have gathered from users who wish for certain changes and improvements in KuCoin’s operations. KuCoin 2.0 will feature a wide array of new features such as scaling, stop orders and upgraded APIs. The second aspect will be customer service. KuCoin is hoping to grow its team of customer service professionals to ensure everyone who has questions, concerns or issues are spoken to quickly. Many digital exchanges are known for enforcing long wait times, and KuCoin is aiming to set a new precedent. Third will be expansion. The company is looking to expand into countries like Vietnam, Russia, Turkey and all Spanish-speaking nations by Q4 of next year. Fourth will be the securing of more funds to potentially invest in new blockchain startups and applications, and last will be employee education. KuCoin states that there is a significant lack of blockchain talent where it’s headquartered, and the company wants to use any remaining funds to educate workers and establish itself as one of the strongest workforces in the business. Gan believes the partnership will make KuCoin a household name and bring more security to its protocols. He’s hoping that KuCoin will eventually rise to become one of the top digital exchanges in the world: He’s also confident the current partnership will lead to further blockchain applications and adoption. He boldly asserts: For Young Guo – a partner at IDG Capital – the company’s work with KuCoin makes “perfect sense”:",

        "passage": "Xu Ke is could probably be defined as a prodigy. She is a native of Beijing, and the founder of China’s first blockchain-based social media site, called “Ono”. At 24 years old, that is likely enough to fit into the “prodigy” category. Xu Ke has a lot more to offer, and her Beijing-based Nome Lab is also the creator of the popular blockchain game, “CryptoDogs”, as well as Ono. The money to found Nome Lab came from poker tables that Xu Ke played on when she was in the USA, studying as a foreign exchange student in California. She was able to use her winnings to amass bitcoins, and she sold 20,000 of them them in 2014 for around $214 USD per bitcoin. With the 2 million USD+ that the bitcoin sale netted her, Nome Lab was born.  All told, Xu Ke has had a pretty amazing run so far. Now she is at the center of Ono, and a very new direction for social media in China. Ono is a dApp, and is all but immune to censorship. This puts it at odds with the centralized control structure that exists in China, though it doesn’t seem to be affecting the growth and popularity of the platform.  Xu Ke, Image from HackerNoon According to Xu Ke, Ono is designed to compete with Facebook. While this might seem far-fetched at first glance, a dApp-based social media platform has some unique advantages that could give it a competitive edge. Xu Ke is well aware of how the social media majors have betrayed the trust of their users, and she puts Ono on an entirely different level.  Screenshots of the Ono App In a recent interview with Forbes, she had this to say about Ono’s foundational philosophy, One of the biggest problems that people have is understanding that the social media majors, like Facebook, aren’t acting in their user’s best interests. The Facebook facade looks friendly, and shows users what their connections are posting, but hidden under the surface there is a lot more going on. Centralized social media platforms like Facebook fall into an ethical gray area. They are controlled by government regulations. They also have hand-in-glove relationships with the highest levels of Western state security agencies, like the NSA and CIA. The most recent Facebook scandal that involved Cambridge Analytica and election manipulation put their view of user privacy on display, but it is one of many that show the risks involved in trusting social media to a private company. Unfortunately for Facebook users, it is one in a string of events that puts the long-term viability of a corporate-government (This structure fits the definition of “Fascist” à la Franco or Mussolini) controlled social media mega-platform into question. In some ways the 2012 Facebook study that openly manipulated user’s feeds in an attempt to change their emotional state should be far more disturbing than what happened with Cambridge Analytica. The Facebook/NSA PRISM program is also a testament to how users put their data at risk, and how little accountability actually exists in the emerging centralized social media landscape. Whether or not user data on Xu Ke’s Ono could be used in a similar way by state authorities is an open question. What is more certain is that if state actors used a blockchain-based social media platform like Ono for their own purposes, there would be an ironclad record of their meddling. A pile of bitcoins wasn’t the only thing that Xu Ke seems to have brought back from her exchange in California. She had this to say on how her platform is organized, “Ono is run democratically, and lets content creators retain ownership over their content and get rewarded,” Xu Ke pointed out in a tweet. It is difficult not to be blinded by the irony in the social media sphere. Facebook, which was born and raised in the USA, would have been an ideal tool for the East German Secret Police, back when they existed. Now, a Beijing-born poker-playing prodigy has started up a social media outlet in China, which puts democracy, ownership, and accountability into a leading role.",

        "passage": "The syndicated loan market is demonstrating how quickly blockchain is going mainstream. BBVA just closed a $150 million USD syndicated loan for Electrica, the operator of the Spanish national power grid. Partner banks MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France were in on the syndicated loan, and both Linklaters and Herbert Smith Freehills had access to the blockchain platform that made the loan possible. Syndicated loans are a seemingly complex process, but they are made more cumbersome by the kinds of communications that are used by the involved parties. Instead of using the internet, syndicated loans are often settled via fax machines. You know, like from in the movies made a few decades ago.  The banking industry isn’t famous for innovation, but it looks like blockchain is creeping into a market that is worth literally trillions of US dollars. The blockchain platform that BBVA used for the syndicated loan was able to allow all the parties to simultaneously access the same database, make changes that were time stamped, and were unable to be altered. In many ways, this is a perfect system for settling syndicated loans, and it could be the beginning of much bigger things for blockchain. Prior to this pilot program, a syndicated loan could take weeks to finalize. There are complex arrangements to make, but a lot of that time was spent communicating, and recording data. This new platform cut the time down to a few days, which has some major implications for the banking industry. According to Ricardo Laiseca, who is BBVA’s head of global finance, blockchain will create, “huge reduction in internal costs,” for banks’ clients. He told the Financial Times that, “We are offering these technologies for collaboration with any other banks . . . This is not just for BBVA, we feel that as a second stage (we are) working on a new markets infrastructure which will be good for everyone,” and that at least five more blockchain settled syndicated loans are in his bank’s pipeline. Syndicated loans aren’t a new idea, and the fact they are still being finalized with outdated technology shows how reticent the banking industry is to innovation. The platform the BBVA and their partners used for the Electrica loan used the Ethereum blockchain, but there are other platforms out there as well. Finastra and NatWest are developing a Corda-based blockchain platform that has been developed specifically for syndicated loans, and it is due to go live on November 17 of this year. With the enormous amount of cost savings, it isn’t hard to see why banks are being forced to go blockchain, whether or not they want to. These platforms could also play a role in the emerging blockchain-based trade finance platforms, which are being deployed in Asia. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) just took their blockchain-based trade finance platform live, and is working with some of the largest banks in Asia to drastically change how trade finance happens. The platform was designed by Chinese insurance giant Ping-An, and was deployed into mainland China before being adopted in Hong Kong. In addition to cutting down the costs involved with trade finance, the new system helps banks to avoid some of the pitfalls associated with commercial lending. The participating banks will have access to other similar financing transactions on the platform, so they can see if they are being quoted costs that are out of line with industry norms. It should be clear by now that not only is blockchain here to stay, but it will probably also become a technology that is required to use in the near-term. When the time and costs involved in facilitating trillions of dollars worth of transactions are slashed by a huge amount, it is only a matter of time until competitiveness forces industry to shift to the more efficient technology.",

        "passage": "Whether it’s Japan, Gibraltar, Singapore or Hong Kong – there is a small selection of nation states that are often regarded as ‘Blockchain Friendly’ and as such, fully embrace the potentialities of the cryptocurrency phenomenon. However, nothing quite matches the provision of blockchain-related products and services as is currently being experienced in the European jurisdiction of Malta. Dubbed as the ‘Blockchain Island‘, Malta recently enacted three key pieces of legislation that provides the country with a stringent regulatory framework for all things cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As such, the island recently caught the attention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to Maltese-based publication the Times of Malta, the IMF have highlighted that the growth of blockchain technology in Malta has created ‘significant risks’ with respect to the threats of money laundering and terrorist financing.  In response to the inherent risks that the IMF for-see, the non-governmental organization have asked the Maltese Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) to implement a 50-point action plan to ensure that domestic firms dealing in cryptocurrencies are meeting their anti-money laundering obligations. More specifically, the IMG took note to a range of deficiencies in Malta’s regulatory framework and as such, have called for immediate action. In order to ensure that Maltese authorities are able to effectively detect, prevent and subsequently seize criminal proceeds that are held in the form of digital assets, the IMF have asked the nation to ensure that the national regulator – the Malta Financial Services Authority, are adequately staffed and resourced. Within the mission report, the Times of Malta claim that the IMF made a direct reference to ‘Virtual Asset Service Providers’. For those unaware, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – a non-governmental organization that provide recommendations for the countering of money laundering abuse, recently issued clarity of what constitutes a Virtual Asset Provider. In a nutshell, any organization that facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrencies to or from fiat currency, or cryptocurrencies in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, is defined as a Virtual Asset Provider. Know more broadly as a third party cryptocurrency exchange, Malta recently saw two of the world’s largest exchanges move to its shores. Both Binance and OKEX – who collectively are responsible for daily trading volumes that often surpasses a billion dollars a day, recently expressed their intention to move their headquarters to the Island. It was also announced in mid-2018 that Binance, in partnership with the Malta Stock Exchange, are set to launch the world’s first ever ‘Decentralized Bank’. Known as the Founders Bank, the project is yet to receive the green light from the nation’s financial regulatory body. Nevertheless, the aforementioned exchanges, among the many others that are located in Malta, will need to ensure that they have the required safeguards to detect and prevent money laundering activity from within their businesses. On top of highlighting strong concerns on the potential risks of blockchain-related activities with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing abuse, the IMF also took note to other leading sectors in Malta. This includes both the iGaming and financial services space, which both have a strong presence on the Island. Moreover, the IMF also held concerns with the recently installed ‘Citizen-by-Investment’ scheme, which allows non-EU citizens to obtain a Maltese passport on the proviso that they inject a minimum of 250,000 Euros in to Maltese government bonds or equities for a period of at least 5 years.",

        "passage": "The BitConnect class action lawsuit just got a new defendant – YouTube. According to a court document that was shared by Coindesk, the lawsuit has been recently updated to include YouTube as well as its parent company, Google, as defendants. But can Youtube be held liable for the actions of an unrelated crypto ponzi scheme? For those unaware, last year saw one of the most widespread and virulent cryptocurrency scams. It’s difficult to calculate exactly how much money was lost to BitConnect, but it’s safe to say that the number was well into the tens of millions. Following the collapse of the scam in January 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against BitConnect as an attempt to recoup some of the losses that investors (or victims) suffered.  Read also: Bitconnect – Is It a Ponzi Scheme? In addition to the various BitConnect corporate entities such as “BitConnect Trading LTD.”, the lawsuit also specifically targets a number of YouTube personalities that recruited for the scheme and likely earned themselves a small fortune in affiliate referral fees for doing so. A few of those included in the lawsuit are “James” of Mytle Beach, SC, “Hildreth” of Laguna Nigel, CA, “Grant” of Miami, FL, and of course, “CryptoNick” aka Nicholas Trovato. According to the suit, these defendants are US-based individuals who “served as affiliates/recruiters for BITCONNECT, soliciting hundreds if not thousands of BITCONNECT investors in the United States and abroad through social media sites such as YOUTUBE and Facebook.” Following this, the filing then lists Youtube and it’s parent company Google as defendants in the case. Since adding YouTube to the lawsuit, many have been wondering to what degree YouTube could actually be held liable, if at all. Coin Telegraph reached out to the law firm behind the class action suit, Silver Miller, and received a quote, which said in part that “…liability is predicated on YouTube’s failure to act after learning from content directly published on YouTube of the readily foreseeable harm posed by its advertising partners… ” In other words, since they ran ads for BitConnect, and failed to act on them or on those doing the recruiting, the law firm asserts that they are liable.  The type of scam BitConnect was trying to pull is in no way new or innovative. It is indeed a tried and tested scam that is been pulled off many times, in many different shapes. BitConnect is also not the only Ponzi scheme that uses cryptocurrency. Indeed, a number of scams like this are running at any given time.  Read Also: Crypto Ponzi Watch – Westland Storage These scams can be found through banner advertisements on all sorts of cryptocurrency websites. Just look for promises of guaranteed returns and unlimited daily profits, and you’ll probably be well on the way to discovering a new scheme yourself. But all these scams are generally fairly small-scale. BitConnect was such a major scandal that it even made it onto a popular late-night talkshow, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. As for whether or not YouTube is liable for damages, the outcome of the trial will undoubtedly set precedent for many years to come and could once again cause a number of social media sites to shy away from dealing with cryptocurrency whatsoever, for fear that they too could get caught in a lawsuit like this one.",

        "passage": "In 2017, the words “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” occupied the computer monitors of nearly every breathing human in the Western world. Mainstream media outlets, like CNBC, Bloomberg, and CNN, were covering the topic incessantly, while crypto’s very own content creators saw their subscriber counts soar to the moon. But by late-2018, gone were the days that “Bitcoin” was a popular word at the dinner table. The aforementioned clamor had died down to nothing more than a mere murmur. But over the past few months, the amount of mainstream coverage the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space has seen has skyrocketed tremendously. Most likely, this is a result of the sudden growth in the value of digital assets, which comes after a 12-month downturn, during which BTC lost 85% of its all-time value.  On Monday, Bitcoin’s journey back to the mainstream limelight took a massive leap forward, with Jeopardy featuring the cryptocurrency for the second, maybe third time. I don’t know about you but it’s tough for me to follow the questions, or answers rather, on “Jeopardy”. Most of the mental challenges that Alex Trebek, the beloved host of the seminal American game show, give to the contestants stump me. There was one clue I recently understood though: Bitcoin uses this technology as its transaction record. The answer to this, a simple “What is Blockchain?”  This mention may seem small, but the show often pulls in 10 million weekly viewers — not bad. This isn’t the first time that Jeporady has centered its sights on cryptocurrency. Late last year — yes, the bottom of the recent crypto crash — the show had an entire section dedicated to crypto. Crazy, right? Some answers included references to Venezuela’s Petro, social media app’s Kin token, and the infamous Kanye West-branded “Coinye” coin, which has notably been slammed with a lawsuit from Yeezy. Jeopardy’s latest nod to Bitcoin comes as mainstream media outlets have begun to actually give the cryptocurrency space some air time. As reported by Blockonomi previously, “60 Minutes”, a world-renowned television program known for tackling tough issues and covering key trends, covered Bitcoin. In that segment, hosted by legendary television personality Anderson Cooper, CBS met with Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard; MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative’s Neha Narula; cryptocurrency entrepreneur Marco Streng, who heads Genesis Mining; the ‘Bitcoin pizza guy’; and BitInstant founder and Winklevoss Twins collaborator Charlie Shrem to gain a fleshed out understanding of the nuances of the industry. More recently, the Winklevoss Twins — the Mark Zuckerberg frenemies(?) turned crypto exchange founders and Bitcoin billionaires — were featured in an episode of “Sunday Morning” on CBS. The eight-minute segment saw the host dub Bitcoin “money that works like e-mail”, and pointed out that the Twins have been at the forefront of two trends — cryptocurrency and social media. This comes as a number of prominent figures in mainstream media have started to flip bullish on Bitcoin. Just two or three weeks back, CNBC’s Joe Kernen, a host of “Squawk Box”, revealed that he understands the difference between something like Libra and Bitcoin. Kernen went on to question the value of fiat monies, noting that he doesn’t like how central banks are inflating away their currencies, sounding exactly like a Satoshi Nakamoto excerpt. Then, economist Tyler Cowen published a Bloomberg op-ed article. In that piece, he gave four viable reasons why Bitcoin is likely here to stay, taking a full 180 from his 2013 stance on the asset, which was one of pure skepticism. And most recently, Jim Iuorio, a CNBC contributor and trader on the floor of the CME, acknowledged that Bitcoin may actually be a viable hedge/safe-haven asset against macroeconomy uncertainty.",

        "passage": "Mainstream payments titan Mastercard continues to make notable forays into the blockchain space. The latest embrace was announced on September 11th, when the company unveiled it had entered into a strategic partnership with the enterprise blockchain consortium R3, the backers of the open-source Corda blockchain project. Namely, the collaboration will see the two organizations “pilot a new blockchain-enabled cross-border payments solution” for “connecting global faster payments infrastructures, schemes and banks supported by a clearing and settlement network operated by Mastercard.”  The meld is about staying at the tip of the spear of global payments said Peter Klein, Mastercard’s executive vice president of New Payment Platforms: The news comes after several major blockchain-centric job openings appeared on Mastercard’s in-house jobs tracker portal last month. Positions being sought included “Blockchain Solutions Architect” and “Director, Cryptocoin/Wallet Product Management.” Those postings indicated the company was preparing to ramp up its blockchain activities further, so the R3 partnership appears to be just the first of many related activities to come as Mastercard continues to dive deeper into the blockchain ecosystem. Of course, Mastercard also made waves back in June when Facebook revealed that the company was among the first 29 organizations that had agreed to join the Libra Association, the governing body that will administer Facebook’s proposed Libra stablecoin cryptocurrency. And while rumors have recently swirled that some of those organizations have considered backing out of the project, Mastercard has offered no indication yet that it’s among the lot whose interest has waned. With the Mastercard-R3 meld as just the latest example, there’s been lots of movement in recent months regarding large players exploring blockchain tech for efficiently facilitating international payments. For example, in July news broke that Japanese authorities were considering whether to create a cross-border network for cryptocurrency payments, not unlike SWIFT for mainstream banking payments. One month before that, Mastercard competitor VISA announced the Visa B2B Connect network, which was built atop the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and designed to help enterprises make inexpensive international transfers. In the spring, a dozen large banks collectively invested $50 million USD into Fnality, a startup focused on using the utility settlement coin (USC) in interbank payments. And not long before that, American banking giant J.P. Morgan revealed its JPM Coin, which is likely to be used within the bank’s interbank blockchain rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN). Taken altogether, these developments bode for some serious competition to Ripple, the backers of the XRP cryptocurrency — a cryptocurrency whose main use case is commonly said to be cross-border payments. The firm is undoubtedly feeling the pressure, or at least to will the keep fighting for its position near the front of the cryptoeconomy’s pack considering XRP is currently the third largest cryptocurrency according to market capitalization. Last month, Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said the company was exploring a series of acquisitions and investments to help improve its position. “We’re in a very strong position, our business is growing strongly, we have a strong balance sheet, and I intend to press our advantage,” Garlinghouse said. Accordingly, Garlinghouse and his associates will need to move such intentions into fruition to stay ahead of its like-minded competitors.",

        "passage": "Transoil International and Solaris Commodities are the latest companies to use blockchain for commodity trading. The two companies used blockchain to settle the trade of 25,000 metric tons of 11.5 percent protein Black Sea wheat that was shipped from the Russian port of Novorossiysk. S&P Global reported on November 12th that the two companies used a blockchain-based agri-commodities trading and financing platform that was built by Swiss firm Cerealia for the transaction. According to the same report, this is the first time that Black Sea wheat has been traded via blockchain. There is no word yet on how much the cargo was worth, or who settled the financial side of the transaction.  Like many companies in the global supply chain, Transoil and Solaris probably want to take advantage of the efficiencies that blockchain has the potential to create. The global commodities trade is archaic in many ways, and blockchain could be the technology that changes a business that has remained mostly static for centuries. By all accounts, the blockchain-based trading platform that Cerealia created worked well. S&P Global reproduced this statement from Cerealia in their report, “An independent auditor has reviewed all the important details of the trade from the blockchain and validated the smart contract, digital signatures, signed document and timestamps. (The auditor) also confirmed that data has been encrypted, that no other data has been stored and that all data is up to date.” Unlike the complex paper-based trade finance system that is still used in most nations today, blockchain provides instant access to all parties that are involved in a shipment. This can help to resolve disputes as they arise, and could simplify tracking throughout the shipping process. The world’s food logistics network is complex. Countries have the ability to connect across vast distances, but keeping track of cargoes can be difficult. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) developed their own blockchain-based tracking that integrates trade finance, which was tested earlier this year. CBA worked with an almond grower in Victoria, Australia, to ship almonds to Hamburg, Germany.  The shipping process involved numerous companies, all of which had real-time access to the location of the almonds as they moves across the planet. CBA integrated and Internet-of-Things (IoT) based tracking system into their blockchain-platform, which makes tracking chain-of-custody much easier. Walmart is another major company that is moving towards using blockchain on a daily basis. As one of the largest retailers of food in the USA, Walmart has to keep track of an enormous amount of product. Until now that has been difficult, which is why they are requiring all their leafy green vegetable suppliers to use an IBM-designed blockchain tracking platform. Instead of having to dive into a paper-based record keeping system that can literally take days to track down where lettuce came from, the new IBM blockchain platform does the same task in a few seconds. Not only that, but it also allows Walmart to locate any other stores that may have the same produce on sale. There are periodic outbreaks of food poisoning that could be mitigated by the system that Walmart is deploying, which means that leafy green vegetables could be the first of many kinds of food to go on the blockchain. Making the food distribution system safer and more efficient is a great thing from a business perspective, but saving lives makes blockchain adoption a no-brainer. Depending on how one wants to measure its age, blockchain is at most a decade old. Realistically the technology is much younger than that, which makes the speed at which it is entering the global marketplace extremely dramatic. With every new use case that shows the value that blockchain creates, the trust that it needs to create grows. The next few years will be very interesting for blockchain development, and the companies that adopt it early will probably be setting themselves up to take full advantage of an amazing technology that is coming into its own.",

        "passage": "ShapeShift is the latest crypto company to reveal big layoffs thanks to the bear market. Revealed via a Medium post, ShapeShift Founder and CEO Erik Voorhees revealed that 37 employees had been let go – an entire third of the current team. “The latest crypto winter is upon us, and today ShapeShift felt the bitter frost,” begins the post. He goes on to name crypto as a “harsh mistress,” one that grows “at rates unseen almost anywhere else in the business world.” In fact, ShapeShift alone had grown 3,000% in 2017.  Despite industry enthusiasts expecting these ups and downs, it’s near impossible for anyone to prepare for them. Of course, ShapeShift has every intention of continuing their mission: “to embrace substantial exposure to crypto assets.” No matter the justification, Voorhees isn’t happy to let go so many of their team. He reveals his sadness in a heartfelt message: The CEO then goes into the company’s mistakes and how they can learn from them. “A lack of focus” marks the biggest issue here. At its start, ShapeShift was a basic tool. This lead the team to work on other projects which turned into a “family” of crypto products. For example, they built CoinCap to track market data. They acquired KeepKey, released some API’s, and more. No matter how well a project was doing, it still pulled team members in all different ways. “They diverted talent and changed hiring priorities,” reads the post. They diversified their offerings too soon, and the main business suffered. Voorhees blames nobody but himself. He then reveals four main issues that hit in 2018: Voorhees goes on to say that he expects most users haven’t held their currencies anywhere outside of a centralized exchange. He hopes that “controlling your own keys” becomes a pillar within the cryptocurrency industry. People should be “proficient in basic financial sovereignty,” he claims. Crypto assets are powerful. That power is difficult to fully understand as of now, but it is “inclusive and empowering.” With this in mind, Voorhees wants to let everyone know that ShapeShift has a new sense of focus, and will be going forward with that from now on. “We don’t want to overstate with grandiose promises,” he says, but they want people to try the product out in the future. Voorhees ends the post with a touching message:",

        "passage": "Last year, Ikigai Asset Management’s chief investment officer, Travis Kling, wrote on Twitter that there is “a significant chance [that] crypto is the best performing asset class in 2019.” While some laughed the former Wall Streeter’s prediction off as a joke, especially considering that Kling made this prediction when Bitcoin was trading around $3,500, he’s been right so far. Hands down, the cryptocurrency market is the best performing asset class this year. Somehow, against all odds, Bitcoin and its ilk have managed to outpace every other prominent asset in circulation for the umpteenth time. This, importantly, comes during a time when prominent economists and investors have claimed the world is on the precipice of a recession.  However, not all subsets of this market have been thriving. Data shows that tokens issued via an initial exchange offering (IEO), which is basically an initial coin offering (ICO) run by a host exchange, have absolutely plummeted. Ouch. Earlier this year, Binance popularized what is known as the IEO — the successor of the seemingly now-defunct ICO and the less-popular, more abstract security token offering (STO). It famously brought the native token of BitTorrent, the torrenting service owned by Tron, to market, and catalyzed a massive wealth creation event in a few weeks time. Not only did the IEO make investors a lot of money but Binance and its partners too. And as such, exchanges across the board sought to replicate the success, kicking off what many on Twitter have dubbed the “IEO Craze”. At first, the hype propagated to other projects. The short-term parabolic rallies and jaw-dropping volumes that were seen with BitTorrent’s token were reflected in other IEOs. But, according to a report from analytics media outlet LongHash, the party didn’t last for long and the hangover hit hard. Citing data from CoinCodex, LongHash reports that out of the 77 IEOs that ended in the first half of 2019, over two-thirds have dropped below their initial value. In fact, the median return on investment of the aforementioned demographic is -81.4%. The median ROI on the IEOs that managed to appreciate is 64%. This isn’t bad, but consider that Bitcoin has rallied by some 230% from its bottom in December 2018. So much about that IEO Craze, eh? While the overall data set seems harrowing, there’s one obvious sore thumb: Binance. As aforementioned, the leading exchange popularized the IEO trend, hosting some of the first successful sales. But what has allowed it to outperform its peers, a majority of which have hosted IEOs that have only plunged in value.  Well, to put it simply, it’s the community and quality of projects that Binance is leveraging. Out of the exchanges seen above, Binance has the largest community of investors. But also important is that Binance heavily vets projects looking to IEO on Binance, even going as far as to release in-depth reports on the who, what, why, and how of these cryptocurrencies. For now, Binance is the King Midas of IEOs. The outperformance of Binance-based IEOs aside, it is important to point out that altcoins have been largely under-performing Bitcoin in 2019 so far. Tokens issued through IEO are, after all, glorified altcoins. As Willy Woo, a prominent analyst, points out, altcoins have plunged over the course of Bitcoin’s recovery, even recently reaching a support line that has been relevant for six years.  While historical precedent says altcoins will bounce off this key level, community sentiment is currently weighing against altcoins, and thus IEOs.",

        "passage": "Japan, home to one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency userbases, is set to experience two high-profile crypto exchange launches this spring that could boost the prospects of digital assets that much further in the powerhouse G12 nation. Those exchanges are Taotao and Rakuten Wallet, and they’re arriving on the heels of efforts by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s vanguard financial regulator, to more tightly manage domestic cryptocurrency margin trading enterprises.  Rakuten’s cryptocurrency plans are advancing, as the FSA announced on March 25th that Rakuten Wallet had registered with the Kanto Local Financial Bureau and is thus greenlighted for launching in the country. Rakuten, already Japan’s most popular e-commerce website, Internet bank, and credit card company, will now add a cryptocurrency exchange to its sprawling operations. The development comes after the company purchased, and thereafter rebranded, the Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc. exchange last fall for nearly $2.5 million USD. In their associated announcement, Rakuten said that the exchange’s former operations will be phased out by the end of March in anticipation of relaunching the new exchange’s services next month. “Rakuten Wallet will support sound development of the industry, and provide a safe and trustworthy user experience by further strengthening its security and service offerings,” the company’s announcement noted. Rakuten Wallet will be followed up in May with the launch of Taotao, a new cryptocurrency exchange that’s raised attention because of one of its investors: Yahoo! Japan. Last spring, YJFX, a subsidiary of the Japanese arm of Yahoo, acquired a 40 percent stake in the crypto exchange BitARG Exchange Tokyo. The enterprise, reportedly purchased for around $20 million, has since been re-envisioned under the moniker of Taotao. The new platform will start its formally-approved operations in using bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as its base trading currencies. The firm also plans to offer crypto margin lending positions in bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), and the Ripple ecosystem’s XRP. And Taotao won’t be Yahoo! Japan’s only recent crypto foray. Back in February, the company’s subsidiary Z Corporation participated in an investment round for Aerial Partners, a crypto tax consulting play. If these two investments are any indication, they likely won’t be the last crypto-centric ventures Yahoo! Japan undertakes in the coming months. The question for now is how much further will the company look to expand its cryptocurrency operations going forward: is the pivoting a permanent shift or flexible experimentation? Only time will tell for now. Earlier this month, the Japanese Cabinet approved amendments put forth by the FSA that will tighten rules governing the operations of cryptocurrency margin lending enterprises in the nation. The approvals came after the agency first submitted a report at the end of last year that called for such enterprises to limit the amount of leverage traders could use on their platforms and to officially register with the Japanese government. Now, with the amendments greenlighted, crypto margin trading institutions in the country will only be able to offer leverage that is four times the amount of traders’ deposits. That reconfigured sum stands in stark contrast to some other firms in the global cryptoeconomy that offer leverage as much as 100 times higher than deposits. The new rules will go live in 2020. They come as the FSA has taken an increasingly proactive stance toward its domestic cryptocurrency ecosystem. Last May, the agency released a five-point regulatory framework that demanded cryptocurrency exchanges in the country increase the security of their platforms in the wake of the devastating Coincheck hack, the largest in the history of the cryptoeconomy to date.",

        "passage": "A local Jersey investor has been scammed of his life savings to the tune of $1.5 million, per reports from the Jersey Evening Post. According to the post, the man- whose name wasn’t provided- was promised as much as 1500 percent returns on his investment. Such returns, given his investment, would have made him a killing. Of course, it’s understandable that he would have fallen for such a scam.   According to the post, the man was scammed over an 18-month period, being gradually milked out of his entire life savings. However, while substantial crypto scams such as this are definitely not news, one thing that seems to distinguish this case from a host of others like it is that the victim, in particular, was said to be an “experienced” investor. The fact that he was swindled out of $1.5 million in a scam, even with all of his experience, is certainly ironic. You’d think that an experienced investor would recognize the qualities of a scam (such as the overly high rate of returns in this case). However, it is also possible that skilled con artists could find a way to work around the safeguards that experience could have instituted in the minds of investors as well.  The victim was reportedly contacted by the scammers after he went online to find out more about Bitcoin. The organization claimed to be operating out of Norwegian territory, although investigators later found evidence of them moving money across various banks all over the world. The scammers tricked this victim into believing that they were offering legitimate Bitcoin-based investments, and over the aforementioned time frame, they continued to trick him into making additional investments.  To add further anguish, investigators from the U.K.’s National Crime Agency reported that there is a slim chance that they will recover the funds he lost. The publication noted that a report on the scam was issued by the Jersey Fraud Prevention Forum the forum encouraged locals of the island to be increasingly vigilant as regards cryptocurrency scams; especially any which might promise excessively high returns.  Mike Jones, the Director of Policy and Risk at the Jersey Financial Services Commission, said, “Following this Islander’s huge loss, we are warning local residents to be extra vigilant when investing in cryptocurrencies or any investment that seems too good to be true and promises high returns with no risk. Always get independent advice from a professional, and make sure the company you’re dealing with is legitimate.” Last month, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) issued a warning to existing and potential crypto investors, encouraging them to be more vigilant in their choice of investment schemes.  In a press release published on April 24, both agencies stated that they’ve come to recognize the rise of crypto scams in which con artists disguise as legitimate cryptocurrency trading businesses and advisory firms, and go on to receive funds from unsuspecting investors with the prospect of investing in crypto-related businesses.  In the release, the watchdogs provided six prominent red flags for illegitimate investment schemes, further encouraging investors to conduct the proper due diligence on any potential investment scheme before releasing funds to it. The red flags included guaranteed high investment returns, unsolicited offers, jargon-filled documents, and overly complicated terms, continued pressure to invest as soon as possible, and the terms of the deal sounding too good to be true. Both agencies concluded by urging potential crypto investors to check the Investor.gov site to look up the license of any investment operators in the government database. Any vestment that isn’t registered and listed on here is most likely a scam.",

        "passage": "For the most part, Mark Zuckerberg has kept his mouth shut about cryptocurrency and Libra. The embattled social media founder, who has found himself in the midst of a number of privacy imbroglios over recent years, has probably found it best not to associate his name with the first form of “corporate money”. Recently, this changed. In a recent quarterly earnings call, Zuckerberg felt a responsibility to address the elephant in the room, making it clear to shareholders and analysts how exactly Facebook is addressing Libra from a regulatory stance.  As it stands, Facebook has over 100 individuals working on Libra. While this is only a small portion of the firm’s 40,000 employees, the cryptocurrency project has made an outsized splash, gracing the headlines of every mainstream media outlet and the lips of some of the world’s most powerful people. As such, it only made sense for Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, to try and tackle the concerns his shareholders have with the project on Wednesday, when the company held its latest earnings call. Speaking on the matter, Zuckerberg made it clear that his company will spend “however long it takes” to make sure that the end product abides by the rules and regulations set in place by the world’s economic and political bodies. He then affirmed that the early launch of the white paper was done in a bid to “address these important questions out in the open”, rather than surprising regulators with a globally-accessible form of money and financial ecosystem. The Facebook chief executive later added: Zuckerberg’s comments abide by the framework set in place by David Marcus, the head of Blockchain and Calibra at Facebook, last week. This, of course, implies that there is an underlying company stance. During the first Congressional hearings about Libra, the former PayPal president also made it clear that they will do everything in their power, including collaborating with regulatory agencies, to “make it work”. Facebook isn’t taking this approach out of pure altruism. Per previous reports from Blockonomi, a representative of the European Central Bank believes that Facebook and its consortium of 27 partners — which includes Visa, PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Booking Holdings, and other key stakeholders — should not launch Libra. The board member, Benoit Coeure, explained that for something as important as a new payment system that will be accessible by over two billion individuals in most of the world’s countries, everything needs to be “safe, robust, and resilient from day one”. Also, Congressional representatives, including Maxine Waters, have claimed that Libra should be blocked from launching until all issues are solved. A push to collaborate with regulators may not be enough to quell fears, however. During the hearings, Brad Sherman, a Congressman that represents California, made it clear that his peers should not proceed with discussions until Zuckerberg appears in front of the committee. (I’m sure you remember Zuckerberg’s last Congressional hearing.) Sherman warned that if launched, Libra could be more dangerous to the United States’ security than 9/11, warning of its ability to be used in illicit activities and data gathering. There has also been some talk of a draft bill that would ban big names in technology from “establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset” that is meant to fulfill the three fundamental tenets of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.",

        "passage": "On April 25th, the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, the state’s top legal officer, declared it had successfully sued for an injunction order from the Manhattan Supreme Court against Bitfinex operators iFinex Inc. and tether (USDT) issuers Tether Limited.  Why? In their court filing, the NY AG alleged that last year Bitfinex lost $850 million USD worth of “comingled” company and client funds and thereafter participated in a cover-up by borrowing from the reserves of tether, a stablecoin, to obfuscate the loss.  The findings, which assert $700 million was discreetly borrowed from tether’s reserves, stem from an investigation campaign the NY AG’s office launched into cryptocurrency exchanges last fall. Bitfinex barred traders from the U.S. and New York in 2018, but Attorney General James has wide purview under the state’s Martin Act to defend New Yorkers who may still be using the platform anyways.  Per the court order, James’s office said Bitfinex’s operators and Tether Limited will be mandated to stop borrowing from tether’s reserves and to cease engaging in any potential cover-up activities while it continues to investigate the matters: The development spooked the cryptoeconomy, as market selloffs began hitting the top coins after word of the news spread. The bitcoin (BTC) price was down more than three percent, to $5,293, on the day; ether fared slightly worse, sinking closer to six percent in that span. Whether the episode will lead only to acute sell pressure remains to be seen. The massive $850 million loss in question apparently occurred after the funds became stuck for an as-yet undisclosed reason at Bitfinex’s external payments processor, the Panama-based Crypto Capital Corp (CCC). That dynamic caused Bitfinex customers’ withdrawals to grind down to a steady trickle, and internal communications revealed by the NY AG’s lawsuit show Bitfinex struggled to receive answers as to why CCC couldn’t move faster in processing the transactions. At one point, a Bitfinex employee told his CCC counterpart that the whole cryptoeconomy may suffer if CCC didn’t take definitive action, saying “BTC could tank below 1k if we don’t act quickly.” Not getting the answers they needed soon enough, Bitfinex’s operators — which are intimately linked with the leadership of Tether Limited — purportedly pivoted to tether’s reserves as an emergency stopgap instead. Bitfinex first turned to CCC for help in 2017 with the latter serving to facilitate Bitfinex customers’ fiat transactions. Notably, the Panamanian firm’s president at the time (and presumably still) was Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, a secretive executive who runs a sprawling network of offshore corporations per the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. Bitfinex has since responded to the NY AG’s court order by challenging the crux of the injunction.  To that end, the crypto exchange argued the CCC funds were, in fact, safe, and that the NY AG had been acting unduly: Bitfinex has given no word for now on what entity they assert is responsible for seizing those funds.",

        "passage": "The institutional narrative has become an integral part of the crypto industry’s story in recent years. As Bitcoin (BTC) collapsed last year, investors held on to hope that institutional stakeholders, whether it be household name hedge funds, pensions, or educational endowments, would dip their toes into the cryptocurrency water. According to a recent report conducted by a trade publication and a prominent startup, this hope has paid off, as effectively all endowments surveyed claimed to have an ongoing play in the crypto and blockchain realm.  According to a debrief of the survey, conducted by The TRADE Crypto and American crypto firm BitGo, 94% of 150 endowments surveyed have invested money in crypto-related projects in the past year, even amid the collapse in Bitcoin. The average amount invested was not disclosed, but endowments’ allocations to this asset class and related technologies likely range in the low single-digit millions to low double-digit millions. Interestingly, these organizations made such investments in spite of their acknowledgment that there are overt risks, including but not limited to volatility in crypto assets, regulatory uncertainty and instability, an absence of liquidity (both in cryptocurrencies and private shares), and, most importantly, a lack of “robust” market infrastructure. In fact, even after considering the risks, a mere 7% of those surveyed expect to decrease their crypto-focused allocations in the coming year, accentuating that endowments expect for the aforementioned issues to see some resolution. The TRADE’s managing editor, Jonathan Watkins, explains: What’s most interesting about this survey, however, is the medium which endowments’ portfolio managers decided to use to foray into cryptocurrency. A jaw-dropping 54% — 81 entities — directly invested in cryptocurrencies through the assets themselves, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., while the rest had gained exposure through index funds or venture capital funds, which they claim needs to be regulated and have sufficient capital flow and proper security measures. While many of the endowments The TRADE & Co. surveyed were likely lesser-known, it is important to note that big names in this subset of institutions have delved into Bitcoin and its derivatives in recent months. Just last week, as reported by Blockonomi, Bloomberg revealed that Harvard Management, the world-renowned educational institution’s $39 billion endowment, had invested in a token sale. In a report on the matter, it was explained that a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing revealed that Harvard, Lux Capital, and Foundation Capital invested $11.5 million in blockchain startup Blockstack in exchange for 95,833,333 Stacks Tokens. In late-February, Bloomberg explained that the “CNK Fund I,” a “cryptonetwork technology” fund managed by the world-renowned Andreessen Horowitz, was in the University of Michigan’s scopes. According to Kevin Hegarty, the chief financial officer at the state-run educational institution, CNK invests in “cryptonetwork technology companies across the spectrum of seed, venture and growth stage opportunities.” It isn’t clear if the institution went ahead with the move, but considering that it already has blockchain investments, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise. While the arrival of institutions hasn’t had a material effect on the value of Bitcoin just yet, a CNBC analyst claims that such investors will propel BTC past its $20,000 high with time. In a recent CNBC “Fast Money” segment, contributor Brian Kelly claimed that institutional adoption, coupled with a growth in crypto networks, will push BTC beyond our imagination “without question” over the next two years. He chalks his statement up to the fact that Fidelity Investments, a renowned financial services provider, has taken an absolutely colossal interest in cryptocurrencies, meaning that the arrival of “smart money” is likely just around the corner.",

        "passage": "Amid news that TD Ameritrade, Fidelity Investments, E*Trade, Facebook, and Microsoft continue to delve into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, the spotlight pointing at QuadrigaCX has seemingly been turned off. But, all eyes are focused on the disgraced, now-defunct Canadian digital asset exchange once again, with news that its founder misappropriated customer funds for his own use. This confirms long-held hearsay that arose on Canadian cryptocurrency forums months, if not years back.  It’s been nearly half a year since QuadrigaCX closed after it lost its founder to a health issue, but many are still trying to pick up the pieces. In a recent report published by Ernst & Young, a “Big Four” auditor tasked with presiding over this crazy case, it was revealed that, as some suggested, founder Gerald Cotten was running a fraudulent crypto exchange. Toronto-based litigator Evan Thomas broke down the report.  Per this new document — an exposé if you will — Cotten had, over the years, created fake accounts on QuadrigaCX with equally as fake “dollars” to purchase legitimate Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin from users. From there, he then sent this cryptocurrency to accounts at other exchanges under his name. What’s worse, he didn’t just sell what he embezzled, but he gambled with it. Almost like some crazy speculators during 2017, Cotten purportedly used margin, meaning leverage, to trade (and often lose) the cryptocurrencies that weren’t exactly his. According to logs, which are hard to come by to begin with, Cotten transferred 9,450 BTC, 387,738 ETH, and 239,020 LTC out of Quadriga — an amount of cryptocurrency worth dozens of millions of dollars at current valuations. What’s weird is that the report implies that Cotten may have traded even more Bitcoin than the logs suggest. One “unnamed exchange” received 21,501 BTC to an account under the Canadian businessman’s name. As of the time of writing this, there are purportedly eight BTC left, amounting to a loss of $80 million. Ouch. While there is now much more known about the case than when the news first broke that Cotten had passed, there has yet to be retribution for those affected by this debacle. The thing is, this news, coupled with previous reports on the subject matter, cast doubt on the idea that the creditors of QuadrigaCX will get their money back in full. The following is a story about one affected, who lost $422,000 via the Canadian exchange after depositing Bitcoin. In a heartfelt tell-all posted via Youtube, Tong Zou, a Canadian-born Silicon Valley engineer, explained his story.  He explained that in late-2017, his Silicon Valley peers were cashing in on the crypto craze, as he sat on the sidelines. But as the market peaked, he FOMOed in, taking out three self-described “stupid” loans from the bank to invest into cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, among other popular assets. Eventually, he managed to pay his debts by liquidating his stake in a Bay Area apartment, leaving him with $400,000 left over. As he already had plans to move to Vancouver, where QuadrigaCX was supposedly located, the technologist tried to find ways to take advantage of good exchange rates. Eventually, he decided on using Bitcoin and QuadrigaCX as a medium, as he hoped that he could not only transfer value quickly, but turn a profit too due to the exchange’s Bitcoin-to-CAD risk premium. Of course, when he decided to issue a withdrawal request, the money never came… There are presumably hundreds, if not thousands that are in Zou’s boat. And as it stands, they are seemingly only slated to receive a portion of the funds. But, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation was recently reported to have picked up the case.",

        "passage": "Permanent loss of funds has been an unfortunate reality for some in the early cryptoeconomy. Fortunately for Binance they’ve just experienced the opposite, having accidentally staked their way into a sum of nearly 10 million lumens (XLM), the native asset of the Stellar network. On July 18th, the Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange giant revealed they “heeded the Stellar team’s recommendations to change some parameters on both cold and hot wallets” back in the fall of 2018.  That’s when the exchange began unknowingly staking some of their XLM holdings, the company explained on Thursday: Having made a small war chest of lumens appear seemingly out of “thin air” as President Trump would say, Binance is turning that XLM trove into an even bigger positive by setting it aside for community rewards. Specifically, the exchange plans to begin XLM staking support on July 20th and thereafter conduct snapshots of its users’ XLM addresses for the ensuing 40-day period. Once that window closes, the users will receive their proportional staking rewards alongside a one-time bonus XLM payment from Binance’s novel trove. Notably, non-stakers who simply hold their XLM on Binance after July 20th will also receive portions of the bonus XLM payout. “This recent support for XLM staking is the latest in a long line of moves we have done to always provide the best for Binance users,” the exchange declared. The lumens price enjoyed an acute boon as the quirky news made the rounds, with a single XLM token trading at $0.088 at press time for an intraday rise of around seven percent. One of the harder hit tokens of the 2018 cryptoeconomy bear market, XLM is still trading 90 percent below its all-time price high of $0.93 — a mark the token hit back in January 2018. The addition of XLM staking support comes as Binance is on the verge of releasing its first in-house stablecoin. This week, smart contract security startup Quantstamp revealed they had completed auditing Binance’s inaugural stablecoin, the pound-pegged Binance GBP (BGBP), with satisfactory results. As part of the audit, the security experts identified a handful of “low risk issues” in the token’s code that the powerhouse exchange has since cleaned up. With the security review finished, the project is all but ready to be released. On the news, Binance chief executive officer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao noted the BGBP would be released on two blockchains: The token appears to have moved from the drawing board to reality in short order. CEO Zhao had first floated the possibility of Binance developing its own fiat-pegged tokens in public comments back in the spring. The BGBP will surely precede other Binance-backed stablecoins, though the company hasn’t specified what fiat currencies may be next on the slate. One thing is for sure: Binance is on a roll. The company just launched its new margin trading platform as part of its “Binance 2.0” campaign. The exchange has also recently announced plans for a cryptocurrency futures platform and Binance US, an operation that will cater to U.S. cryptocurrency traders.",

        "passage": "As the markets took a big tumble in the past day to the SEC’s decision to postpone their decision on a Bitcoin ETF, Wall Street analyst Tom Lee is once again weighing in on bitcoin. He states that the currency is slowly regaining its market share, a sign that the coin is “returning” following a lengthy series of price slumps that began in January of this year. He advises bitcoin enthusiasts to stay calm and patient as the cryptocurrency continues its gradual ascension of the financial ladder.  Image from Coin360 Long considered one of bitcoin’s biggest advocates, Tom Lee has often spoken of the currency’s price, and predicted positive outcomes when most of his colleagues have fallen victim to negative sentiment. For months, Lee has predicted that bitcoin will finish the year at $25,000, though he recently changed this figure to an even $20,000, meaning bitcoin would be no higher than where it stood in December 2017. This has aroused skepticism in die-hard bitcoin addicts. At press time, the largest digital currency by market cap is trading for just over $6,500 – hardly something to get excited about considering it was almost $13,000 higher eight months ago. This means bitcoin would need to spike by over $10,000 in just 16 weeks if Lee’s prediction is to come true. Nevertheless, the financial expert has stuck to his guns about bitcoin’s ending value, which in turn has caused many notable figures in the cryptocurrency arena to weigh in with their own predictions. Arthur Hayes – co-founder of BitMEX – believes that bitcoin could end the year at $50,000, while Tim Draper alleges that bitcoin will strike $250,000 in 2022. Tom Lee has also offered additional predictions, stating that bitcoin could hit the $91,000 mark in 2020. Lee fully admits that bitcoin’s price is nowhere near his initial end-of-year figure, nor does he believe the price is where it should be. However, he says the currency’s market value is the true indicator of bitcoin’s strength, and he alleges it’s slowly returning from oblivion. “The news that we have seen from the SEC saying bitcoin’s a commodity, to the potential for an [exchange-traded fund] is causing investors to decide that bitcoin is the best house in a tough market,” he recently explained on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” He continues on to say, “Bitcoin isn’t broken if it’s holding at its present levels. I think people are afraid it is going to go back down to $6,000 or whatever, and that it will never come back from those bear markets.” The biggest indicator of bitcoin’s strength, he asserts, is the “regaining of its market share.” At the time of writing, bitcoin dominates nearly half of the cryptocurrency market (47.6 percent). While this is nowhere near the 80 percent peak bitcoin held in January 2017, it’s a solid mark above the weak and unstable 36 percent it possessed just a year later. In addition, big things are happening in the bitcoin space that Lee believes could potentially assist the currency’s market value to grow even further. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently made it clear that bitcoin was not – and never would be – a security but was, in fact, a commodity, along with most other forms of crypto. While regulation may still occur in the future, one can expect to witness legislation that will be less stringent and easier to bear. In addition, the Intercontinental Exchange announced last Friday that it was entering partnerships with several major companies – including Microsoft and Starbucks – to potentially build a large, open and regulated digital asset ecosystem. Lee is confident such a system could assist in bitcoin’s legitimization. He also says that while bitcoin is not “openly” reacting to what’s occurring in the news through relative price increases, it’s growing market value indicates that the currency is garnering a solid financial base. “I think bitcoin dominance is actually showing that the market is reacting to what’s been taking place,” he claims.",

        "passage": "If ETH is money, then the growing gig economy possibilities around Ethereum should only boost that dynamic further. Of course, like most aspects of the cryptoeconomy, much of the Ethereum-based innovations that are being built toward gig economy workers are still fledgling themselves. Accordingly, some of these innovations’ novelties are still in an experimental state or on the horizon for now.  With that said, the potential is there to change how the blooming arena of temporary work is performed in our increasingly hyper-connected, digital world. And the stakes are getting higher, as the Harvard Business Review estimated last year that 150 million workers in Western Europe and North America were now gig workers. The fact is there are no shortage of centralized freelancer-focused companies in the world today, but many of the most popular ones charge high fees or run unaccountable operations and thus leave much to be desired for workers. A rather infamous episode happened a few years back, when popular freelancer website Elance rebranded to Upwork. Unfortunately, the transition wasn’t desired or smooth for many in the platform’s community, and the shift essentially ruined the profiles of more than a few of Elance’s top earners and beyond. That anecdote is not dissimilar in spirit from one provided by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin on his own website, wherein Buterin described how he first realized the immense frustration that a centralized company can create: And so later came Ethereum and the dApps built on top of it, and they offer new decentralized ways forward. One of those ways is to efficiently disintermediate middlemen in gig economy transactions where middlemen can be egregious, e.g. in charging unreasonably high withdrawal fees. There are a few interesting threads currently happening around the Ethereum ecosystem that may be of increasing interest to freelancers. For example, this month the decentralized employment project Opolis announced it had received a grant from DeFi heavyweight and Dai stablecoin creators MakerDAO, with the grant being set to help Opolis integrate Dai payments within its jobs platform.  Toward powering the “future of the self-sovereign worker,” the employment project will thus soon have Dai within its wider umbrella of freelancer-friendly offerings: Another project that strikes in a related vein is Sablier, which was first introduced back in June. Billed as a dApp for offering continuous salaries on Ethereum, Sablier — which was recently downgraded to the Rinkeby testnet out of caution — is designed around offering real-time payments to workers — payments by the minute, even.  But the dApp should return to the mainnet in due time, particularly if the MakerDAO team’s grant to the effort last month is any indication. Yet Opolis and Sablier are but two examples of the possibilities that freelancers might be increasingly interested in using going forward. Even a simple Ethereum address and a verified cryptocurrency exchange account is enough for a remote worker to start getting paid online, but there are other creative options too. Consider, for example, how Week in Ethereum News author Evan Van Ness offers annotated versions of the newsletter to those who have purchased associated non-fungible tokens of his own creation. These could be early sparks in a new kind of gig economy.",

        "passage": "Blockchain technology is catching on in an area that is a far cry from FinTech. According to a recent report from Accenture, more than 85% of aerospace and defense companies are expecting to use blockchain in their businesses by 2021. Aviation may not seem like a natural fit for DLT, but it offers some advantages for an industry that needs to keep strict records for safety reasons. John Schmidt, who is Accenture’s managing director of aerospace and defense, told Aviation Week that, “It’s very rare that we talk about something two years in a row but this technology is taking off much faster than we thought it would,” and that, “Another interesting industry statistic is the number of companies already working with blockchain – not necessarily having a system installed but working with the concept. More than half of them are working with the technology today.”  Private blockchains are a great new tool for businesses that need to make sure their records are secure, and precise. Unlike blockchains that use proof-of-work to validate transactions, private blockchains are operated via a server or network that doesn’t rely on mining to incentivize the blockchain’s operation. Some have compared private blockchain technology to a regular shared database, but the inability to alter blocks once they are created is a new benefit that fits into the aviation industry perfectly. Mr. Schmidt expanded on this aspect of blockchain technology, “It (blockchain) also helps us be in a better position to create the feedback loop from what we’re seeing in the asset, its life and its usage to put back into engineering,” and that, “This can then be used to enable changes to better improve the asset’s life.” Aircraft maintenance is a vital part of making sure that planes are safe to operate, and blockchain-based records could help airlines make sure there weren’t any oversights that are potentially dangerous. Blockchain can be used to track everything that happens to major parts of an aircraft, like the engine, so that any problems have a better chance of being detected. Earlier this week Accenture confirmed they would be working with Thales at Farnborough to create a blockchain platform to establish more confidence in supply chains. They plan to use blockchain in order to create a secure record of every part that is used in an aircraft’s construction. Any issues would be easier to track down, across the entire indutry. This is more or less the same idea that the IBM Food Trust operates under, which illustrates the utility of blockchain’s capabilities in numerous vital industries. Gazpromneft-Aero, who operates of the Gazprom Neft aviation refueling business is working with S7 Airlines and Siberia Airlines to use a blockchain-based smart-contract system for aviation fuel payments. The group calls the new kind of contract Aviation Fuel Smart Contracts, or just AFSCs for short. The Deputy CEO for Logistics, Refining and Sales at Gazprom Neft, Anatoly Cherner, thinks that, “The development and implementation of digital services like this is an important element in creating a digital platform for managing the logistics, processing and sale of oil products at Gazprom Neft. Implementing digital transformation projects in cooperation with major partners will enable the company to reach a new level in technological and operational efficiency, right now,” according to a statement released after the program was announced. When AFSCs were announced they were the first commercial use of blockchain technology in the Russian market, and have helped the participants cut down on all the hassles connected with the airline fuel payment system. Blockchain appears to be a better system for numerous applications, which offers significant improvements over existing database technologies. The aviation industry is another early adopter of a technology that appears to bring numerous advantages to the table.",

        "passage": "Canadian crypto exchange Maple Change has been hacked. The company is reporting over $5 million in losses – virtually all its funds – and says it cannot pay any of its customers back. However, many are questioning whether the company was hacked or if the loss was something planned by internal representatives, as the operator of Maple Change website ultimately removed all related internet presence before being identified by “online detectives.”  Based in Edmonton, Maple Change says that all its money has been stolen. After deleting its internet presence temporarily, various customers published the IP address of the company’s owner, prompting the exchange to immediately re-establish itself online. The hack allegedly took place on Sunday October 28, roughly six days after the company handled trades equaling nearly $64,000 in BTC. This was later followed by an upgrade to its server and then the attack, which representatives initially mentioned on Twitter: Many customers challenged the validity of these statements, to which Maple Change responded: The closing of the company’s many related accounts prompted several people to declare the maneuver an exit scam, in which the people behind the exchange are the ones responsible for the stolen funds. At the time of writing, the amount of money stolen is alleged to be roughly $5.9 million. After a user discovered a chief executive’s IP address and published it for all respective customers to see, Maple Change issued a statement online, explaining: The company later explained that most of its funds would be going to the developers responsible for creating the exchange’s remaining coins: Maple Change also said that it would not be refunding any bitcoin or Litecoin funds at this time. Changpeng Zhao – CEO of crypto exchange Binance – took to Twitter to renounce Maple Change for not using cold wallet storage. He later explained that someone should create a list of all the world’s crypto exchanges and rank them according to their storage techniques. He states: Interestingly, around the time of the reported hack, Maple Change garnered its highest amount of traffic in roughly six months, another reason why people are suspicious of the company’s reports. However, Maple Change is not listed on CoinMarketCap.com, which suggests that its daily trading volume is less than significant. Maple Exchange presently ranks amongst the lowest crypto platforms on the CMC charts.",

        "passage": "The Ethereum network has the chance to become a new and increasingly important kind of public infrastructure. The latest proof the winds are blowing in that direction? Banco Santander, the largest bank in Spain and the 16th largest bank in the world, just deployed the “first end-to-end blockchain bond” using the smart contract platform. Announced by the Spanish multinational commercial bank on September 12th, the bond will notably live entirely on Ethereum.  The Madrid-based bank itself will be the issuer, and $20 million USD worth of bonds will accordingly be released. The bond will offer a “a quarterly coupon of 1,98%” through the bank’s Securities Services department, which is “acting as tokenization agent and custodian of the cryptographic keys” associated with the offering. Likewise, Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), the institution’s arm for international enterprise clients, served as the “dealer for the [bond’s] issuance, continuing the work which started in Santander’s blockchain lab in 2016.” Moreover, Santander will track the actual cash used to buy the bonds on Ethereum’s mainnet and the aforementioned quarterly coupons will similarly be tracked on-chain.  “The bank issued the bond directly onto the blockchain and the bond will also continue to exist only on the blockchain: a first step towards a potential secondary market for mainstream security tokens in the future,” Banco Santander said in a Thursday press release.  Those are tall words from one of the largest banks in the world. But when it comes to disintermediation, the institution is talking more like a cypherpunk and less like one of the international stage’s biggest banks. “Thanks to this automation, the one-year maturity bond has reduced the number of intermediaries required in the process, making the transaction faster, more efficient and simpler,” Banco Santander said on the news. The bank’s chief financial officer, José García Cantera, added: The blockchain space as a whole is still fledgling, and the backers of Ethereum are still very much so trying to position the platform to be useful for many people from many walks of life. With that said, it’s no secret that Ethereum has long been fingered as an ideal platform for the neutral issuance of financial products. Bonds are no exception in that regard. So somewhat unsurprisingly, the Ethereum community has started to see some major traction on the bonds’s front. Back in the spring, Societe Generale — popularly referred to as SocGen — released €100 million EUR in bonds — dubbed “obligations de financement de l’habitat” — as security tokens on Ethereum. As the bank explained at the time of the announcement: Santander appears to be increasingly interested in blockchain tech. Back in May, news broke that a dozen major banks had collectively invested $50 million into Fnality, a startup that was working on a blockchain project around the utility settlement coin (USC) project. Speculation mounted that Santander was involved, as the bank had been involved with UBS Group AG, which had originally sponsored the USC initiative. With the latest bond news, it appears in the least that Santander is doing more than just its homework on blockchain tech.",

        "passage": "Last year, talk heated up around so-called “smart contract platform fragmentation.” Espoused by the likes of Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, the concept dealt with how competing smart contract platforms might respectively achieve popularity in different regions for various reasons. While the cryptoeconomy is still young, Ethereum has generally proven to be a bulwark against such fragmentation to date, having held its ground as the go-to smart contract platform thus far.  Of course, it’s not that interesting things aren’t happening on other platforms, or that platform fragmentation can’t still intensify. It’s just that Ethereum has established a network effect that seemingly grows into a bigger advantage every day. As of last month, Ethereum had approximately four times as many developers as the crypto ecosystem’s next largest development community, Bitcoin. Roughly speaking, that means almost 20 percent of all cryptocurrency developers are working around ETH. And some projects like Synthetix have walked back work on other platforms, in their case EOS, to work exclusively on Ethereum. It’s against this backdrop that Joel Monégro, a partner at cryptocurrency venture capital firm Placeholder, published on article on September 3rd dubbed “Ethereum and the Seven Dwarfs.” Therein, Monégro notably made a case for why the reigning smart contract platform was like tech giant IBM in the smart contract arena. The Placeholder partner started out by explaining the phrase “IBM and the Seven Dwarfs,” which was popularized decades ago to suggest just how far behind other computer makers of the day lagged behind IBM.  His point? Ethereum now seemingly finds itself in a similar dynamic, insofar as its network effect is so far out ahead of other networks presently. “Ethereum is the IBM of the smart contract blockchains: it may not be the ‘best’ technology, but it works well enough and has amassed a distribution advantage that will be hard to overcome by its competitors,” Monégro wrote near the start of his piece. The Placeholder partner later added: Monégro went on to say that such observations weren’t mean to be an ax against other projects, but rather merely that Ethereum seemed poised to keep its top position in the market “for at least the medium term,” like IBM did back in the day. People can agree or disagree on Monégro’s projection, to be sure. And Ethereum’s current “dwarfs” may go on to create great value for people just like many of IBM’s “dwarfs” did. But if Monégro’s aforementioned estimation bears out for the foreseeable future, it will have big implications for the newer wave of smart contract projects like Algorand, Cosmos, and Polkadot. Namely, it will entail the builders and communities of these fledgling networks continuously contending with Ethereum as a massive elelphant in the room. All projects have their own strategy for doing so. For example, Polkadot and Cosmos are heavily focusing on interoperability, which is important and useful work. But will the nuance be enough to bridge the gap with Ethereum’s lead? And does it matter? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s clear who’s king of the smart contract hill for now. “[W]hen it comes to the top, in terms of size, scale and impact, ETH looks a lot like the IBM of our era,” Monégro accordingly concluded his Tuesday piece.",
