        "passage": "The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the nonprofit with dozens of high-profile members focused on helping businesses use Ethereum, is launching a new initiative to make its namesake public blockchain “work for all.” To do that and help further the EEA’s roadmap in general, the organization announced on August 6th it had appointed Aya Miyaguchi, the Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation since early 2018, as the latest member of the alliance’s Board of Directors.  On the news, Miyaguchi hailed the appointment as another domino dropping in the Ethereum Foundation’s efforts to bridge the divide between Ethereum can do and how enterprises can leverage the smart contract platform’s infrastructure.  “As blockchain adoption accelerates, it’s important that the Ethereum Foundation work to connect businesses with the latest research and development coming from our worldwide community, and that we convey our challenges and experiences while better understanding those impacting industries,” she said. As for the aforementioned new campaign, the EEA has dubbed it the Mainnet Initiative. The effort will lead to the formation of a working group that will serve as a hub for alliance members collaborating on public chain Ethereum tech. The idea is that the effort will make Ethereum “like the internet” by working toward “public network components [matching] the commercial market requirements needed to allow the world to connect to Ethereum.” Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum and Board member at the EEA, characterized the coordination campaign as coming right on time, insofar as major companies have been increasingly experimenting with building on and through the smart contract platform: Some of those large organizations include Microsoft, EY, JP Morgan, and Google Cloud. In just this year alone, Microsoft has created a verification tool for Solidity, EY and JP Morgan have respectively worked on Ethereum privacy tools, and the Google Cloud team has posited how to create hybrid “blockchain cloud” apps using Google’s BigQuery, Ethereum, and the decentralized oracle middleware tech of Chainlink. In their Tuesday announcement, the EEA said more would be revealed about the Mainnet Initative at the upcoming Devcon 5 conference set to take place from October 8th through the 11th in Osaka, Japan. Notably, the Ethereum development conference’s second round of tickets went on sale on Tuesday and sold out in short order.  Tickets were purchasable in ether (ETH), leading to the latest light gust in the Ethereum community’s meme debate as to whether ether is, in fact, money. On the one hand are those like Vlad Zamfir who have argued ETH isn’t money because “there is no monetary policy” backing it. On the flip side, others like EthHub co-creator Eric Conner have asserted if ETH can be used like money, it’s money.  Zooming out, this year’s Devcon should make for a busy one, particularly if the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract is launched there. Earlier this summer, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake noted the possibility could play out. “One of the reasons to have this very public ceremony is so that we can all agree on the exact address of the deposit contract and avoid scam deposit contracts,” he said.",

        "passage": "It’s a crucial time for Facebook, and the company itself knows this. After the official announcement of Libra, last week, the spotlight beamed on the firm and how it intends to handle copious amounts of financial data. In the wake of the hearings and debates that are sure to precede the launch of Libra, the social media giant is taking proactive steps to quell concerns over the security of its cryptocurrency.  Earlier today, the company put out a vacancy for the Head of Data Science at Calibra wallet- its in-house wallet application. Per the job description, the selected candidate will be in charge of monitoring and analyzing user data, while also coming up with resolutions on how these data can be progressively applied. The company is calling for people with quantitative analysis, data presentation, and data handling skills for the role, as well as an ability to “drive data quality across the product vertical and related business areas.” The job vacancy is the latest in Facebook’s sprawling efforts to beef up its blockchain posse. As it stands, the social media company has over 20 blockchain-related vacancies open, as they are looking to double down on the development of Libra and other associated endeavors. However, one of the most exciting vacancies at the company would have to be the one for a Public Policy Manager. The vacancy, which was posted today as well, shows that Facebook is searching for an official who would analyze potential policy risks, while also “responding strategically to related legislative and regulatory initiatives.” While there is a myriad of qualifications, Facebook specifically details experience in “payments, commerce, blockchain, digital identity, cryptocurrency, and related policy issues, as well as experience working on technology policy issues generally.” The company’s search of a Policy manager is especially interesting, considering the situation that the company has found itself in. While there was a lot of anticipation concerning the announcement of Libra, even the staunchest optimist would agree that the reactions so far haven’t been particularly warm. While crypto heads have busied themselves by analyzing the asset and criticizing areas such as its multiple currency peg and whether- or not- it is truly decentralized, authorities have focused more on the risks it poses to customers. A day after the Libra whitepaper was published, Rep. Maxine Waters, Chairperson of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, called for the social media company to delay its development. In response to Waters’ request, the United States Senate has scheduled a July 16 hearing on the currency. Entitled “Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,” the hearing is set to look into a wide array of security issues, including how Facebook expects to ensure best practices in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards and handle Libra customers’ privacy. Countries like Russia have been vocal about their distaste for the currency. Speaking to a local news outlet, Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Market Anatoly Aksakov said Russia won’t legalize the upcoming stablecoin from the tech giant. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also issued a stark warning about the potential risks of the large tech firms entrance into the finance space and how it could disrupt the status quo. The bank made this known in a new economic report titled Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and Risks, where it specifically called out Libra. The institution, which is owned by the world’s central banks said regulators must ensure a level playing field and prevent the abuse of financial data by big tech firms.",

        "passage": "Despite the market’s up and downs, it would be foolish to dismiss Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cryptocurrencies in general. Regardless of asset prices or SEC regulation, the underlying blockchain technology is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. According to Stephen Palley, a blockchain attorney with Anderson Kill, that will always be the case even if the prices stay down.  On top of this, Palley claims that the recent SEC regulation changes do not affect the recent market crash. This assertion goes against analyst declarations, but it isn’t a baseless claim. “I’m not sure that there is necessarily any connection between recent SEC activity and the price of cryptocurrencies. It’s difficult for me to see a causal relationship,” said Palley in an interview with Bloomberg TV. The lawyer continued, stating that crypto is a global market. Digital assets aren’t only reliant on the United States, and securities laws differ across the world. SEC regulations do not inherently affect the whole world of crypto. Palley is bullish on the future of crypto as well. “I would not write off bitcoin, and I would not write off Ethereum. These are very interesting technologies.” It’s safe to say that he truly believes this too, as his career is reliant on the success of the crypto space. That, and he thinks we should think longer term about the market. The current, smaller-scale ups and downs will have little to do with crypto’s long-term success. Recently, the SEC went after and took down two cryptocurrency startups for hosting illegal ICOs. The two companies in question, Paragon and AirFox, were required to pay $350,000 in fines. They also had to refund any investors that put money into the ICO. Paragon had to pay $12 million and AirFox $15 million. It is somewhat believed that the SEC was after the crypto space due to these takedowns. Palley was asked about these claims, though he thinks little of them: The SEC has taken down multiple different crypto startups. In every case, the government agency has had good reasons for doing so. Assuming the shutdowns are “attacks” on the community is a tad rash. Also, Palley calls out the crypto community for some of its actions. Just because securities laws aren’t up to snuff, that doesn’t mean they don’t apply to crypto. This is a new technology, and it must adhere to the laws established. If there was some message from the SEC, Palley believes it would be “we told you. Follow the law. Palley also claims that the SEC movements have no bearing on ICO interest. He even recently received a call from someone in Europe regarding a new ICO: Companies that think they can use ICOs to raise money and then not abide by these laws are wrong says, Palley. Those groups deserve to be taken down for not following the rules. The lawyer’s crypto predictions are similar to that of Tom Lee from Fundstrat. Lee still believes Bitcoin will hit $15,000 this year:",

        "passage": "Coinbase has stunned the cryptocurrency world once again with a fresh announcement that the exchange has begun what they call exploratory research on adding five new assets. A few of those assets come as a surprise, while others seem to have been nearly a given for some time now given their general growth.  It’s important to note before we begin that Coinbase as stated in no uncertain terms that there are no guarantees that any of these assets will be added at all. Instead, the company stated that they will begin officially researching these assets and whether or not they can be added from both a technological perspective and a legal one. The lineup of assets currently undergoing investigation include Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Zcash, 0x, and Stellar Lumens. One asset that is notably absent, however, is the infamous Ripple XRP. When Coinbase announced recently that they would be including Ethereum Classic, the announcement was met with an outcry of frustrated investors that were expecting the next asset to be added would be XRP. This time is no different as XRP fans are once again expressing their fury and discontent. One user on Twitter even suggested that all XRP investors “delete Coinbase” as the exchange has not demonstrated any interest in adding their asset of choice.  And another disappointed XRP believer:  Another interesting point was a large number of Tweets asking for various other assets to be added in the future, with more than a dozen users asking for the exchange to consider adding DigiByte, and a handful of requests for assets like Verge. Zcash is unique among all assets being offered or considered by Coinbase as it does allow for completely anonymous transactions. Zcash transactions are not anonymous by default, but with the correct wallet, transactions can be made that are currently untraceable.  Read also: How to Mine ZCash Suggestions have been made that perhaps Coinbase will only accept deposits of Zcash that come from non-anonymized sources. Specifically, the post says: Further, the blog post announcing the exploration of the new assets stated that it is possible that not all assets will be available for trading in all areas, or even that some assets can only be bought and sold within the platform, but withdrawals and deposits would not be allowed. Currently, Coinbase has not made any statements detailing exactly how this would work as we are still in the early stages. The blog post also included a section providing some additional information about the upcoming launch of Ethereum Classic trading support. The article stated that Ethereum classic is already a confirmed asset and will be made available once it is ready. Unlike these five assets announced today that are only in an exploratory phase, Ethereum classic does not require as much work as it is technically virtually identical to Ethereum, and asset that the exchange is supported for quite some time now. The Medium post in question states: Following the announcement from Coinbase, all five of the assets that are being explored by Coinbase saw sharp price jumps, with some jumping as much as 25% after the announcement.  It is conceivable that we will see more general upward movement like Ethereum Classic has had since its announcement. However it is still entirely possible that some or even all of these assets will not end up being added to Coinbase, or may only be added in a highly simplified manner. We suspect that in the coming days, the price jump that we saw today will slowly even out and will only appear again once Coinbase officially confirms which assets are being included.",

        "passage": "The institutional narrative has become an integral part of the crypto industry’s story in recent years. As Bitcoin (BTC) collapsed last year, investors held on to hope that institutional stakeholders, whether it be household name hedge funds, pensions, or educational endowments, would dip their toes into the cryptocurrency water. According to a recent report conducted by a trade publication and a prominent startup, this hope has paid off, as effectively all endowments surveyed claimed to have an ongoing play in the crypto and blockchain realm.  According to a debrief of the survey, conducted by The TRADE Crypto and American crypto firm BitGo, 94% of 150 endowments surveyed have invested money in crypto-related projects in the past year, even amid the collapse in Bitcoin. The average amount invested was not disclosed, but endowments’ allocations to this asset class and related technologies likely range in the low single-digit millions to low double-digit millions. Interestingly, these organizations made such investments in spite of their acknowledgment that there are overt risks, including but not limited to volatility in crypto assets, regulatory uncertainty and instability, an absence of liquidity (both in cryptocurrencies and private shares), and, most importantly, a lack of “robust” market infrastructure. In fact, even after considering the risks, a mere 7% of those surveyed expect to decrease their crypto-focused allocations in the coming year, accentuating that endowments expect for the aforementioned issues to see some resolution. The TRADE’s managing editor, Jonathan Watkins, explains: What’s most interesting about this survey, however, is the medium which endowments’ portfolio managers decided to use to foray into cryptocurrency. A jaw-dropping 54% — 81 entities — directly invested in cryptocurrencies through the assets themselves, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., while the rest had gained exposure through index funds or venture capital funds, which they claim needs to be regulated and have sufficient capital flow and proper security measures. While many of the endowments The TRADE & Co. surveyed were likely lesser-known, it is important to note that big names in this subset of institutions have delved into Bitcoin and its derivatives in recent months. Just last week, as reported by Blockonomi, Bloomberg revealed that Harvard Management, the world-renowned educational institution’s $39 billion endowment, had invested in a token sale. In a report on the matter, it was explained that a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing revealed that Harvard, Lux Capital, and Foundation Capital invested $11.5 million in blockchain startup Blockstack in exchange for 95,833,333 Stacks Tokens. In late-February, Bloomberg explained that the “CNK Fund I,” a “cryptonetwork technology” fund managed by the world-renowned Andreessen Horowitz, was in the University of Michigan’s scopes. According to Kevin Hegarty, the chief financial officer at the state-run educational institution, CNK invests in “cryptonetwork technology companies across the spectrum of seed, venture and growth stage opportunities.” It isn’t clear if the institution went ahead with the move, but considering that it already has blockchain investments, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise. While the arrival of institutions hasn’t had a material effect on the value of Bitcoin just yet, a CNBC analyst claims that such investors will propel BTC past its $20,000 high with time. In a recent CNBC “Fast Money” segment, contributor Brian Kelly claimed that institutional adoption, coupled with a growth in crypto networks, will push BTC beyond our imagination “without question” over the next two years. He chalks his statement up to the fact that Fidelity Investments, a renowned financial services provider, has taken an absolutely colossal interest in cryptocurrencies, meaning that the arrival of “smart money” is likely just around the corner.",

        "passage": "Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations within the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry is something that exchanges can no longer ignore, especially if the platform in question has a gateway that facilitates fiat currency. With a lack of infrastructure in place to stream-line the process, verifying a user’s identity can be a somewhat slow and inefficient procedure. Recognizing the need to fast-track this process, Australia Post, the country’s national postage company, have recently launched a new product that will allow cryptocurrency exchanges to complete KYC validation within just a few minutes.  Known as “Digital iD”, the service will alleviate the need for customers to wait days on end before they are able to access their newly created account. Under current AML regulations in Australia, cryptocurrency exchanges are required to identify the customers that use their platform. This will most commonly consist of a Government issued ID (such as a passport or driving license) and in some cases, a proof of address (such as a bank statement). The concept involves Australian citizens undergoing a one-time registration process with Digital iD, which once confirmed, allows users to confirm their identity with a click of button. Although this will initially see the user upload a range of documentation with Digital iD, once the process is complete they will be able to verify their identify with any merchant that accepts the technology. Not only does this benefit the cryptocurrency exchange platforms themselves, insofar that there is no longer a need to install hugely expensive KYC departments, but it will also reduce the underlying security risks for the user. The reason for this is that there is no need to continuously distribute sensitive documents online. If falling in to the wrong hands, it would potentially allow a bad actor to perform identity fraud.  An additional option that Digital iD users have is that they can decide how much of their personal information they want to share with a particular merchant. For example, if a vendor only requires confirmation that the customer is above the age of 18, the Digital iD user can opt to simply share their name and date of birth, rather than needlessly sharing their driving license and proof of address. This could also be useful in the event that a cryptocurrency exchange requires enhanced customer due diligence on a user, which typically arises when larger volumes are transacted, or a particular withdrawal request surpasses a certain amount. The Digital iD team have already formed a notable partnership with Australian cryptocurrency exchange Digital Surge. The platform not only allows users to buy, sell and trade a range of cryptocurrencies, but they also offer users the opportunity to pay Australian utility bills via Bitcoin. On top of the Digital Surge partnership, Digital iD are also close to securing a deal with two additional Australian-based cryptocurrency exchanges, notably Coin Loft and Coinjar. With the barriers of KYC and AML obligations significantly eased, the Digital iD concept could bring a new wave of interested parties in to the cryptocurrency industry. For one, some sectors of society simply do not feel comfortable uploading personal documentation to a platform with very little trading history, especially in an industry that is often a victim of external hacks. However, with the backing of Australian Post, an organization with an established reputation that dates back more than 200 years, the aforementioned reluctance may no longer be an issue. The Digital iD application is available to download for free via the Google Play or Apple iTunes store.",

        "passage": "The cryptoeconomy’s vanguard cryptocurrency just saw its highest valuation yet in 2019. On April 1st, the bitcoin (BTC) price consolidated over the $4,000 USD mark as buy pressure pushed the OG crypto past $4,100 and then up towards $5,000 for a time in the early hours of April 2nd.  The sharp uptrend, underpinned by $10 billion in trade volume on the day, comes as the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s top assets have been relatively non-volatile in recent weeks, with BTC markets in particular having been sideways since December 2018.  Bitcoin’s price may still be down more than 70 percent from its all-time high of just over $20,000 USD in late 2017, but the coin’s sudden acute surge combined with recently improving sentiments in the space will undoubtedly stoke speculation that the bearish crypto market cycle that began last January is waning. Where BTC’s valuation goes from here in the short-term remains to be seen, though mid-term optimism in the cryptoverse could grow if traders take bitcoin’s latest move as a sign of what’s to come in 2019. That will all surely hinge on if bitcoin can maintain support above $4,000 in the interim. An interesting correlation with the fresh bitcoin price rise has been a spike in BTC transactions over the past few days.  Blockchain co-founder and CEO Peter Smith on his Twitter, where he highlighted that April 1st saw Bitcoin’s mempool exceed more than 51,000 transactions — an amount that marked an activity increase of approximately 3,300 percent in just one week. Why there’s been such a sudden flurry of transactions is an open question for now. One possible contributing factor could be that the bitcoin price’s recent consolidation over $4,000 has simply brought more traders back to their portfolios. Visa may currently offer considerably higher throughput-per-second capabilities than Bitcoin, but both payments networks approach the concept of money in drastically different ways, and that’s an important dynamic to consider whenever attempting to valuate BTC. Of course, it’s worth mentioning that both networks are constantly evolving — sometimes steadily and sometimes in sudden leaps — and that the competition between them is a fluid, if not asymmetrical, one. With that said, Bitcoin hasn’t done bad for itself in that competition if the project’s transaction volume in 2018 is any indication.  According to a new report from cryptocurrency data analytics firm DataLight, the average bitcoin transaction amount in 2018 was $41,615 — many orders of magnitude higher than Visa’s average transaction size of $90 in the same span. The company’s researchers said: The Bitcoin network’s large transaction size average indicates it’s popular “for larger, probably international payments,” per DataLight. Notably, the network’s $3.4 trillion in total transaction volume last year put the cryptocurrency within relative striking distance of the $11.2 trillion worth of transactions that Visa then facilitated. There’s room for growth yet if Ikigai Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Travis Kling’s new Bitcoin “insurance policy” op-ed offers any clues. Thererin, Kling perceptively noted: And with the possibility of getting annualized investment returns going forward via second-layer Lightning Network nodes, the long-term future of bitcoin seems safely aimed toward further maturation.  Things are still very early on, in any case. And that dynamic is simultaneously a downside and a blessing for the genesis crypto.",

        "passage": "One has to admire the ego that economist Nouriel Roubini is carrying around. In a recent missive the famed economist decided to unleash another torrent of hate against cryptos, blockchain and anyone who doesn’t have a seemingly pathological disgust for what he calls, “nothing more than an Excel spreadsheet or a database with a misleading name.” Nouriel Roubini didn’t feel like stopping at weighing in on a technology, and chose to make sweeping statements that are as absurd as they are inaccurate. This passage from his article is absolutely choice,  The idea that blockchain is a “byword” for libertarian ideology is wildly absurd. Blockchain-based platforms are being patented by most major banks, and international powerhouse IBM is actively working to implement blockchain platforms with partners like Walmart. It would be hard to find a global corporation that was less libertarian than Walmart, or the global money-center banks. Let’s get this out of the way, cryptos were never, “the mother of all bubbles.” At their peak the entire sector was worth under a trillion USD, which isn’t even as large as Apple, based on their market cap at the time of writing. Bitcoin is a revolutionary way to use the internet, and no one can ever take that away. Will Bitcoin be the next global financial system? Probably not. In all likelihood, Bitcoin was never designed to replace the world’s banking system. It has spurred massive development across numerous innovation hubs, like Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, and Thailand, which is impressive for a technology that came into existence around a decade ago. The World Bank is also issuing bonds on a blockchain platform, but Mr. Roubini doesn’t seem to be too concerned with reality at this point.  Read: World Bank Partners With CBA to Issue Blockchain Bonds There is no denying the fact that there is a lot of money being spent on developing blockchain platforms that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency. Faced with this, Nouriel Roubini seems to be pulling a page from Orwell’s 1984, and redefining words so they fit into his worldview. Never mind the fact his definition of blockchain requires you dive into the cognitive dissonance pool head first, and read on, “Moreover, in cases where distributed-ledger technologies – so-called enterprise DLT – are actually being used, they have nothing to do with blockchain. They are private, centralized, and recorded on just a few controlled ledgers. They require permission for access, which is granted to qualified individuals. And, perhaps most important, they are based on trusted authorities that have established their credibility over time. All of which is to say, these are “blockchains” in name only.” If you can swallow that line of thought, North Korea might have work for you in their Ministry of Truth, or whatever they call their propaganda creation department. Mr. Roubini also applied the GINI coefficient to the Bitcoin economy, as though it was a real country. The damnation of Bitcoin went further and included allegations of white male billionaires acting as messiahs, as well as crypto market transaction price fixing by nations like China and Russia. Last year was all about hating cryptos and blockchain. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon did it, and China was right there with him. Today JP Morgan is patenting blockchain technology, and China is doing a lot to support blockchain development. Hong Kong has decided that blockchain developers are worth creating emigration exemptions for, and the blockchain start-up funding market in Singapore is white hot. By today’s standards, cryptos were never that big of a bubble (clearly last December’s crypto prices were bubbly, viewed on a relative basis). Now all the cryptos combined might be worth a quarter trillion dollars, which is about half of what Facebook is selling for at the moment. So, you know, not a big market. More than a decade ago when Nouriel Roubini was railing against synthetic bonds, he was talking about a massive market that was fragile enough to make the global financial system grind to a halt. He went against the grain, was correct, and gained a lot of credibility as a result. Now he is building another intellectual position, but he is taking much bigger risks on a much smaller market which is clearly thriving. One wonders why.",

        "passage": "Venezuela is rapidly becoming an exemplar of a socioeconomic basket case. More than a decade of wildly ineffective government policies have left the once prosperous nation in dire straits. CoinCola, a leading crypto exchange, recently announced they would be taking steps to help Venezuelans escape from a broken monetary system with discounted transaction fees and referral rewards on their platform until the end of October. CoinCola is also adding Dash to their OTC trading platform. Dash has rapidly become a favorite crypto for people in Latin America. CoinCola users will now be able to use their local fiat currency (e.g. bolivar, pesos or euros) to buy and sell Dash.  Dash Core Group CEO Ryan Taylor commented on the new partnership via a press release, The Venezuelan government has destroyed a vibrant economy. Today the average Venezuelan has literally no access to basic social services like health care and police protection. Needless to say, in such a dystopian situation, the Venezuelan monetary system shattered many years ago. In an effort to stem the depreciation on the Venezuelan Bolivar, President Maduro announced recently that the Bolivar would be devalued by 95%+, and pegged to the Petro. Unfortunately for the Venezuelan people, the Petro is likely just another sham. Instead of being backed by hard goods, the Petro is backed by Venezuelan oil reserves, which are essentially worthless under the present circumstances. The dire state of just about everything in Venezuela is probably part of the reason why cryptocurrency use is on the rise. When compared to their domestic currency options, the fluctuations in crypto prices look very tame. Cryptos are also out of the government’s reach, which is a huge benefit to a population that is being antagonized by a seemingly power-mad quasi-dictator. While many think that China has been successful in kicking crypto out of the Middle Kingdom, according to CoinCola Founder and CEO Allan Zhang, “ CoinCola is averaging 100,000 transactions every month on our platform. We are the second largest public OTC platform in the world by transaction volume and at this time 95 percent of total transactions are from Asia.” CoinCola is dedicated to expanding their demographics beyond Asia. Mr. Zhang described the motivations behind his company’s recent expansion, “With our partnership with Dash, we will be truly global. We decided to partner with Dash because it is the most efficient digital currency for payments, offers lowest fees, and provides InstantSend technology. Dash represents a strong presence in Venezuela, Latin America, and the rest of the world. We are very selective in with which coins we list to our platform and we are proud to now offer Dash to Venezuelan users.” It is possible that in the future, governments will have to contend with a new decentralized financial system that limits their options to abuse the trust of their population. In the absence of a reliable form of money, it is almost impossible to create a functioning, modern economy. CoinCola looks like they are on the leading edge of offering economically marginalized new opportunities. To help the population of Venezuela, and Latin America, gain access to their platform, they will be launching a new version of their app that features a Spanish interface.",

        "passage": "This week, Enjin Coin, a modular blockchain platform centered around tokenized gaming, hit the limelight and saw its ENJ cryptocurrency price acutely surge after reporting indicated, and the project’s leadership confirmed, the Ethereum-based coin play had entered a partnership with international smartphone manufacturing titan Samsung Electronics. After Samsung announced its crypto-friendly Galaxy S10 smartphone last month, chatter swelled that the phone’s in-built Samsung Blockchain Keystore would support ether (ETH) and ERC20 tokens in the very least. A reveal picture of the Keystore had shown in-app mock holdings of ETH, ENJ, and Basic Attention Token (BAT).  However, Enjin Coin has garnered much more than ERC20 support on the S10, as Enjin’s Vice President of Marketing Simon Kertonegoro later confirmed his team’s partnership with one of Samsung’s biggest arms. Kertonegoro told CoinDesk. Specifics on the collaboration are nonexistent for now, then, other than both partners are based out of South Korea and that smartphone tech is all but certain to be central in the team-up. The hearty adoption news led to investors acutely piling into ENJ, lifting the cryptocurrency into the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and pushing the ENJ price up nearly 80 percent on the day.  In a since deleted tweet, even Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao got in on the clamor. In responding to popular cryptocurrency pundit Boxmining’s comments above, Zhao said, “Congrats to ENJ, solid tech wins.” In the wake of the partnership’s revelation, Boxmining has been closely tracking rumors and leaks around the ENJ and Samsung mesh and has highlighted how purported images of the S10 show direct support for ENJ and the project’s ERC1155 gaming token standard.  A fruitful prospect for token platforms is non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or assets that leverage digital scarcity. And the ability of NFTs to foster new kinds of digital commerce is often put forward as an example of how cryptocurrencies can add novel and innovative dimensions to the booming gaming industry. The Enjin program, then? To streamline tokenization in gaming by making it easier and more efficient to create NFTs than existing ERC standards allow for. In this context, Samsung’s apparent embrace of Enjin isn’t necessarily surprising. The eSports scene has exploded in South Korea and beyond in recent years. In collaborating with Enjin, Samsung has positioned itself to make penetrations into the cryptocurrency and gaming markets, both of which could see further explosive growth yet over the next few decades. When the cryptoeconomy reached its peak bleakness in 2018, even major and positive news stories didn’t seem to move crypto prices up, if at all. Things have looked a little bit different in 2019, though, as a few alts have seen some recent momentum — enough momentum to have more traders wondering if the bearish cryptoeconomy is beginning to turn bullish. Some of the bigger movers so far this year have been litecoin (LTC) and Binance Coin (BNB). Smaller projects that have done well more recently have been ENJ and ChainLink (LINK), a decentralized oracle middleware project. Whether these price runs are just blips amid a wider bear market remains to be seen, however.",

        "passage": "We just can’t seem to get away from phony initial coin offerings (ICOs). A former businessman turned cryptocurrency enthusiast in Brooklyn is facing up to five years in prison for organizing two fake ICOs in 2017.  ICOs, though still relatively new, remain a popular way for new businesses and startups to garner capital for their operations. Through an ICO, business ventures can garner funds – usually via ether tokens – from investors who in return, are granted special access to an entirely new coin developed by the business in question. Investors can then utilize this coin to gain access to the company’s products and services. It’s a straightforward give some, take some partnership between the funder and the funded. But sometimes, greed and avarice take over one’s initial business dealings, and over the past year, many of these ICOs and similar funding methods have turned out to be fake. 2018 has proven to be a huge year for phony ICOs. Thus far, over $500 million has been lost to ICOs that up and disappear once they start. Investors are usually left with lighter pockets, damaged pride, and a handful of enterprise-based tokens they can no longer use. In this case, the fraudster goes by the name of Maksim Zaslavskiy, a former institutional developer and self-appointed “businessman.” Zaslavskiy pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in front of a New York judge on Thursday, November 15, 2018. He also confessed to defrauding about 1,000 separate investors with a cryptocurrency called RECoin, the first digital asset to allegedly be backed by real estate listings. In addition, Zaslavskiy claims to have sold special “diamond” tokens that were purportedly backed by real, physical diamonds. Both claims – along with the tokens being advertised – were fake, as there are no blockchains powering them. U.S. district attorney Richard Donague explained in an interview: Court documents claim that Zaslavskiy told his investors RECoin had a “team of lawyers, professionals, brokers and accountants” behind it, and that roughly 2.8 million separate tokens had been individually sold up to that point. In truth, RECoin had only attracted about 1,000 investors. FBI assistant director-in-charge William Sweeney explained that Zaslavskiy and his associates “dressed old-fashioned criminal schemes in the language of new currency” to garner funds they didn’t earn and had no rights to from unsuspecting (and new) investors. The judge overseeing the case issued a warning to the crypto industry, saying that simply labeling something a digital asset does not make it money, and that using the term “cryptocurrency” will not give phony initiatives any special leeway. He commented that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on all fraudulent cryptocurrency projects, and those looking to defraud their investors should expect heavy consequences. Aside from a potential five-year prison sentence, Zaslavskiy is also facing civil charges from the SEC. These charges will be settled once the court decides on a proper sentence. A similar story occurred recently on the opposite side of the country when on November 9, 2018, Joseph Kim in Arizona was fined approximately $1.1 million and given a 15-month prison sentence for allegedly running phony bitcoin and Litecoin schemes against several investors including, his former employer. Court documents report that Kim had misappropriated his employer’s funds between the months of September and November of 2017. During this time, Kim was working at a Chicago-based trading firm. He secretly transferred the company’s tokens from the exchange into his own wallet, then left his position with the company to go out and solicit investors.",

        "passage": "The former head of global electronic trading at Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Greg Tusar, is optimistic about cryptocurrencies regardless of this year’s bear market, according to an interview with Bloomberg. He’s working there alongside CEO Jennifer Campbell and President Marc Bhargava, both of which are also co-founders.  Tusar’s company analyzes liquidity between different exchanges and provides market information to clients including high-profile investors and hedge funds. It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is in an odd state. We’re failing to properly regulate, working against scams and threats, stigmas, and more. Tusar understands the overall skepticism, and knows that no one group can help clients work out cryptocurrencies “from beginning to end.” He claims that exchanges need to cater to all aspects of the market, alongside educate investors on the ins and outs: After 13 years at Goldman Sachs, Tusar definitely has knowledge on the subject. As global head of electronic trading, the now CTO commented on regulations, markets, and more as the face of the company. He was even pronounced partner in 2008. Between Tagomi and Goldman, Tusar worked at KCG Holdings in New York as head of client market making and execution, before heading up as CEO at Greywolf Consulting. What’s interesting about Tagomi Holdings is it comes in the middle of a long-running bearish market. In fact, it’s predicted that the market may fall even harder, with Bitcoin hitting a low of $1,500. It doesn’t help that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is refusing Bitcoin ETFs thanks to insecurity and lack of regulation regarding the asset. The group is also going after different companies that fail to register assets as securities. That said, even with prices falling, the market isn’t nearly as volatile because of it. Campbell comments on the current state of the market, stating that “In periods of lower volatility, tools like those Tagomi provides, which reduce transaction costs, will become far more important.”  Read: What is a Bitcoin ETF: Complete Beginner’s Guide Tusar claims that their clients and investors are optimistic about cryptocurrencies, however. Some of these backers include Founders Fund by Peter Thiel, Collaborative Fund, SV Angel, Digital Currency Group, and Brainchild. He comments on his clientele: After such an unfavorable year for asset prices, ICOs, and regulation in general, it’s great to see companies like Tagomi emerge from the ashes. Every emerging market goes through a tight space before becoming successful. It’s vital that we continue to engage investors, start new companies, push blockchain use cases, and more to keep interest high and the industry going. In fact, some might argue that this early stage is the best time to get involved. Right now, we’re seeing innovation across the board despite all of the scams and bad press surrounding cryptocurrencies.",

        "passage": "It’s no secret that Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrneis a big fan of cryptos and blockchain technology. Now Overstock’s venture capital arm, Medici Ventures, has picked up 20% of Israeli wine tracking company VinX. The model that VinX is seeking to globalize is based on the wine sales system used by the Bordeaux Futures Model. Instead of buying wine after it has entered the marketplace, the token system that VinX created lets buyers have a crack at a bottle of wine while it is still in the barrels. This wine futures system will help buyers to ensure that the wine they purchase is authentic, and could also help producers gain working capital from wine before it is ready to be bottled.  Future wine production would be registered as tokens on a blockchain, and then could be purchased by interested parties. Much like other kinds of futures, prices could rise or fall before the physical commodity is delivered, which could engender another layer of financial speculation in the wine market. Regardless of how the market develops, this platform does have some potential advantages for consumers. Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk that, “There are a lot of middlemen in the wine industry that can be eliminated with blockchain, there is a lot of problems with counterfeits. We also think this technology is democratizing the purchase of wine.” It is likely that the ability to buy and trade wine in a tokenized form will ultimately add to prices paid by consumers. At the moment it is nearly impossible to speculate digitally on wine that is still sitting in barrels across the planet. If VinX is successful in popularizing their wine tokens, seemingly anyone would be able to speculate in wine, widening the market to a previously unknown degree. Jacob Ner-David, the founder of VinX, said that by, “Bringing consumers in direct contact with producers early in the wine-making cycle,” everyone involved will benefit. He went on to say that, “We are riding the wave of direct-to-consumer, which Overstock has been a leader of for almost 20 years,” via a statement. The global wine market is valued at more than $300 billion USD annually. Of that market, it is thought that there is at least $3 billion USD worth of counterfeit wine sold every year. The press release that announced the investment by Medici also claimed that up to 20% of the wine that is sold globally carries incorrect labeling. Patrick M. Byrne expanded on the challenges that wine buyers face in a press release, “Like any economy, the wine industry has difficulty scaling its middlemen-heavy systems in parallel with the growing demands of an increasing global market. VinX’s steps in tokenizing wine futures while allowing wine enthusiasts to know without a doubt that the bottles they purchase are filled with authentic wines will position the entire industry as a model of a new global economy that replaces old boys’ networks with frictionless trust through technology.” Like other markets that are regulated, but still subject to graft, the wine industry may benefit from this new platform, especially on the high end. VeChain, a Chinese blockchain company, is working on a similar platform to VinX. They claimed that, “At least half of the Chateau Lafite-Rothschild consumed in China is fake,” which hurts trust in the marketplace. When a person is paying a hefty price for a unique product, they want to make sure they get what they pay for. Blockchain could be a big part of ensuring the quality of highly sought after, and often counterfeited items. ReportLinker recently predicted predicted that over the next five years, blockchain applications in the food and agriculture industry could be worth as much as $400 million USD. The recent tie-up between Walmart and IBM for a blockchain-based veggie platform would lend credence to this position, which may be representative of much bigger things for blockchain technology.",

        "passage": "Cryptopia, a New Zealand-based cryptocurrency exchange, has not had the best start to 2019. As per the hack it experienced last month, which resulted in a multi-million dollar token heist, New Zealand police initiated an investigation of their to own ascertain whether or not the platform could have prevented the hack, or worse, was someway involved. However, it has now been reported that New Zealand Police have given Cryptopia the all clear to resume trading activities. Whilst New Zealand Police have also indicated that they are still engaged in the final stages of their investigation, this should indicate at the very least that Cryptopia themselves were not involved in any internal malpractice. It is important to note that whilst New Zealand authorities have given the green light for Cryptopia to re-open, it remains to be seen when or if the platform will decide to proceed.  Whilst it was New Zealand Police that initially took on the case, this was eventually passed on to the High Tech Crime Group. According to Detective Inspector Greg Murton, who spoke with the New Zealand Herald, the investigatory unit have “Finished the main part of the work required by the High Tech Crime Group at Cryptopia’s business premises, although HTCG staff remain there finishing up aspects of their work”. Murton continued to clarify that the final stages of the investigation are not preventing the exchange from re-opening their doors to the public. Interestingly, when Murton was asked whether or not the team responsible for running the exchange were likely to have criminal charges put against them, the detective refused to comment. For those looking for clarity on the specific amount stolen, as well as the underlying mechanism that allowed the hackers to succeed in their criminal endeavors, this still remains unclear. At the time of writing, the general consensus within the industry is that the amount stolen amounted to $16 million worth of cryptocurrency tokens, or $25 million New Zealand Dollars. This figure was initially brought forward by a blockchain analysis firm called Elementus. Through the use of an Ethereum blockchain analysis tool used by the research firm, Elementus believe that $16 million worth of Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens were stolen. However, as the analysis engine only covers tokens that run on the Ethereum blockchain, the researchers at Elementus argue that the total amount may in fact be higher. Whilst Cryptopia director Pete Dawson would not confirm the exact amount that was stolen from their internal servers, he did state that the figures being reported by the media were misinterpreted. Moreover, Cryptopia founders Rob Dawson and Adam Clarke have also failed to notify the public of the exact amount that was stolen, which, taking in to account that the hack happened just over a month ago, is somewhat surprising. We are also yet to ascertain what policy the team at Cryptopia are going to implement with respect to lost customer funds, if any at all. Whilst it remains to be seen whether or not the exchange will decide to re-open its doors now that it has the green light from New Zealand authorities, it also remains unclear as to what affect this will have on Cryptopia’s customer base. Although various exchanges that have previously been accustomed to an external hack and since recovered, research suggests that this has been in direct response to a customer re-payment plan for those that have had funds stolen.",

        "passage": "Crypto hackers have turned their attention to Outlook, MSN and Hotmail—three email services owned by tech giant Microsoft. According to a report published on tech news media Vice on April 30, multiple cryptocurrency holders, who were affected by a recent hack, have alleged that the hackers also stole their crypto holdings. Trouble started when hackers gained access to the account of a customer support employees at Microsoft. Citing an Email from a Microsoft spokesperson, a separate report by TechCrunch revealed that the criminals found it easy to access customer accounts using the login details of the tech company’s login details. What they found was a treasure trove of data which was used to siphon users’ crypto funds.  A Dutch tech forum carried the complaint of a victim, named Jevon Ritmeester, who alleged to have lost 1 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth about $5,200 as at press time) to the attack. According to Ritmeester, he tried logging into his account on Kraken and upon finding that his account wasn’t accessible, he found that there were several “login changes” notifications in his Email trash compartment. He also found that all Emails that mentioned Kraken were automatically moved to his trash folder. For most crypto investors who haven’t activated a two-factor-authentication (2FA), once a password reset is sent to the mail, the funds are as good as gone. Ironically, Kraken only just announced that it would be initializing 2FA last month, so it couldn’t have been so difficult for the hacker to have gained access to his Kraken account. Reddit, a separate forum, also carried various complaints of victims who experienced similar situations. For instance, a user known as Shinatechlabs claimed to have lost “25,000” worth of digital assets as a result of the breach, but he declined to provide further details on how or when it happened. To paper over the cracks, Microsoft did what large corporations do best. They issued a statement to calm fraying nerves. Microsoft sent an initial Email to the affected users, assuring them that critical information was safe. The company noted that, while the hackers got hold of the Email addresses, folder names, Email subject lines, and the Emails that they communicated with, Email content- including login credentials, passwords, and attachments- were out of their reach However, events that happened since then have shown that this is contrary to the case.  The issue of keeping cryptocurrencies safe online is one that keeps investors and crypto exchanges awake all night. One security measure that is highly recommended is the 2FA, which requires the investor to retrieve a passcode sent to their phone before they can access their cryptocurrencies. The recent cases of sim swapping have shown us just how easy it is to bypass that measure. For a lot of people, storing their funds in a cold wallet with strong private keys is secure enough—not anymore. On April 23, security consulting firm Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) published a report about the “blockchain bandit,” a cybercriminal who had so far been able to steal up to 44,744 Ether (ETH) tokens by guessing weak private keys. While one might think that guessing a private key correctly is a “one in a million” move, ISE reported that this criminal had been able to guess about 735 private keys, all of which gave him unrestricted access to the accounts of his victims. Adrian Bednarek, a Senior Security Analyst at the firm, reported that he came across the criminal by accident. He pointed out that as opposed to accessing these accounts by brute hacking, the criminal simply generated faulty random numbers and looked for faulty code.  From there, Bednarek noticed that some of the wallets that were linked to the private keys recorded large debit transactions into a single address. He predicted that the hack could have resulted from a defect in the underlying codes of the software used in generating them. However, it could also be possible that the hacker used some of the most common passphrases (such as 12345, 0000, abc123, etc.) on multiple private keys and somehow, got lucky.",

        "passage": "Like it or not, crypto is used for crime. While mainstream media likely exaggerates their reports on Bitcoin-enabled crime, especially when they say everyone in the industry isn’t above board, these decentralized forms of money have found use in non-kosher scenarios. As reported by Blockonomi previously, Ciphertrace recently found that aggregate losses incurred by investors and firms due to cryptocurrency crime have reached $4.3 billion in the first half of 2019. A similar report from Chainalysis found that in 2019, dark web transactions made with Bitcoin, Monero, and other digital assets will amount to at least $1 billion.  On Thursday, Chainalysis, the blockchain analysis unit, unveiled a “Know Your Transaction (KYT) alerts” solution. The gist is to allow “cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions”, especially exchanges dealing with digital assets, to “mitigate exposure to regulatory and reputational risk by helping compliance teams focus on the most urgent activity and enforce compliance policies while better allocating resources.” So here’s how it works: when Chainalysis discovers a transfer/transaction that “involves a risky counterparty” and is of a suspicious value, it will send an alert to the client. To find questionable transactions, the firm will weigh the category of transaction, the parties on the end of the transaction, amount, direction of funds, among other factors to determine what level of alert to send out. Alerts are available for 15 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, and some ERC-20 tokens. John Dempsey, VP of Product, Chainalysis, accentuated the importance of KYT alerts in a press statement: While it isn’t clear which firms, agencies, or individuals will be adopting KYT alerts from the get-go, there’s one great and pertinent use case that this writer has thought off: deterring the laundering of funds gained through PlusToken. For those who missed the memo, PlusToken is an Asia-centric crypto scam that has purportedly gathered billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and other digital assets. Recently, the founders of the scheme, which marketed the project as a wallet that generated high-yield returns, exited, attempting to run away with a purported 200,000+ BTC and nearly one million ETH stash. Six ringleaders were caught, but the scheme’s known addresses continue to see outflows. Industry commentator and investor Dovey Wan has claimed that PlusToken’s remaining team members are sending “50 to 100 BTC” blocks to exchanges to presumably cash out and live on the stolen funds. Of course, exchanges don’t want to be an accessory in laundering PlusToken’s ill-gotten capital — hence KYT alerts. Chainalysis’s product release is actually quite timely. Per previous reports from Blockonomi, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC this week that anonymous/pseudonymous transactions that cryptocurrencies can enable do pose a security threat or “risk” to America and its allies. To back his point, the Secretary of State cited the 9/11 attacks, which is something that Congressman Brad Sherman did to bash Libra last month: Pompeo thus argued that “electronic financial transactions” should be regulated by the same laws that preside over a global payments platform like SWIFT. Chainalysis’s latest product is likely to help with such regulation. So while KYT alerts aren’t the end all and be all of cryptocurrency surveillance and regulation, it is a step in the right direction in the eyes of global governments.",

        "passage": "This weekend, the world’s central bankers descended on a small town in Wyoming, Jackson Hole, to talk policy — monetary policy. While the conversations were centered around fiat monies, crypto — or “digital assets” at least — became a topic of discussion when the Bank of England’s governor brought up the matter. It’s crazy to think that a mere ten years after Bitcoin was birthed, some of the most powerful individuals on Earth are seriously discussing cryptocurrency.  Speaking in front of a group of central bankers on Friday at the Economic Policy Symposium, Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, took some time to discuss the future of finance. He argued that the world is in need of an entirely new monetary and financial system, citing his sentiment that the U.S. Dollar-based system that exists today is somewhat archaic. In fact, Reuters reports that Carney said the USD is currently playing a “destabilizing” role in the world economy, citing the effects of globalization and trade spats. He added that with the dollar being the de-facto reserve asset of the world, with USD being a primary settlement tool for international trade and central banks hoarding the currency, “developments in the U.S. economy, by affecting the dollar exchange rate, can have large spillover effects to the rest of the world.” Carney then brought up potential alternatives to the USD, namely a “synthetic hegemonic currency” that would exist through a digital asset model. He claims that such a crypto asset would decrease the dollar’s dominance, as it would be backed by multiple fiat currencies and accepted by global partners. Talk around such a currency naturally led the Bank of England chief to Libra, which he claims is an “intriguing” concept. Carney asserted that Libra likely doesn’t have the potential to succeed, citing regulatory concerns. Indeed, ever since the project was formally unveiled in June, governments the world over have been scrutinizing the product, claiming that it will propagate crime and global financial instability should it launch. And, of course, members of the Libra Association are looking to pull out of their agreement with Facebook. Many believe that a global cryptocurrency — be it Libra or something less corporate — will only be a boon for the adoption and price of Bitcoin. Raoul Pal, the former head of Goldman Sachs’s hedge funds sales division and the chief executive of Real Vision, the implementation of a new monetary system is likely to be a boon for Bitcoin.  In a sub-tweet, Pal further explained his thoughts, responding “exactly” to a comment claiming that a widely-adopted fiat digital asset will act as an on-ramp for the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the wide adoption of a digital form of money will acclimate society to transition to Bitcoin and decentralized solutions, especially if governments are encroaching on the privacy and safety of citizens. While there is a talk about a global fiat cryptocurrency, many nations have been going ahead with plans to digitize their local sovereign monies. Just recently, an official of the People’s Bank of China revealed to a group of Chinese bankers and economic pundits that it is prepared to launch a digital currency that is based on a blockchain-like system. While the official didn’t give a concrete date, China is likely aiming to make its digital currency available before Libra goes live.",

        "passage": "One of the minds behind the Lightning Network — Bitcoin’s proposed second-layer scaling solution — has just authored a paper formally outlining another method for optimizing the reigning public blockchain. That mind, Tadge Dryja, is a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative. He’s renowned in the cryptoverse for having co-published the Lightning whitepaper with Joseph Poon in 2016.  His newest contribution to the cryptocurrency scaling arena? Utreexo, a so-called accumulator, which would slim down unspent transaction output (UTXO) sets, or the state, for Bitcoin full nodes. The result of the slimming would be making such full nodes easier and less costly to run, i.e. slowing the usage of storage space.  To that end, Utreexo can be used to streamline validating in Bitcoin. As Dryja explained of the system: Indeed, Utreexo and methods like it could pave the way to users eventually running Bitcoin full nodes straight from their smartphones. The idea for accumulators have been around for more than two decades, and Dryja’s Utreexo isn’t the only accumulator work that’s been pursued in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to date — for example, leading researchers at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University have had their own relevant ideas. Yet Dryja’s Utreexo whitepaper suggests the long sought tech is closer to reality than ever, and his methodology is likely to usher in a new wave of accumulator research in the space. And that means full nodes may imminently be getting lighter and lighter. As Benedikt Bünz, one of those aforementioned Stanford researchers, has previously commented on accumulator-focused innovation: Now that Utreexo is open for review, it may only be a matter of time until a wallet project first implements the tech. For some, the Lightning Network and block size increases are the predominant possible avenues for scaling Bitcoin. But they aren’t the only avenues. Alternative and contribution solutions, like Utreexo, are rising. Another one of these alternative solutions? Statechains, a new and trusted scaling protocol.  Authored by Seoul Bitcoin Meetup founder Ruben Somsen, statechains are not a competing solution to Lightning but could rather work in parallel as coordinated off-chain systems. As Somsen explained in a recent introductory post on the tech: Somsen went on to add that, “in a nutshell this is the core concept, and […] it’s deceptively powerful.” As the Lightning Network’s progress continues to hum along, Bolt Labs is angling to boost the second-layer scaling solution’s privacy. The startup raised $1.5 million USD in April to further its mission of using the BOLT Protocol to bring anonymous shielded addresses to users of Lightning, ZCash, and beyond. Bolt Labs’s founder Dr. Ayo Akinyele has said BOLT can make it so “no one can link you to [a] payment unless you disclose the information.” Thus with the march of innovations like BOLT, Utreexo, and statechains, second-layer infrastructure is steadily blooming in multiple directions.",

        "passage": "In 2017, China suddenly did a u-turn on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Within months, the nation went from a leading innovator in this nascent sector to one of the most anti-crypto states, implementing bans on certain cryptocurrency media outlets, foreign exchanges, the trading of Chinese yuan for Bitcoin or altcoins, crypto events, and more. While China has seemingly started to loosen its grip on cryptocurrency actors under its jurisdiction — as made evident by the massive Bitcoin OTC flows purported to be from Chinese traders — the nation’s authorities are still on edge about this industry.  Case in point, a prominent Chinese venture capitalist recently revealed that a massive project based in the region got “clamped down on by the police”, despite the seeming lack of outward wrongdoing. According to Wheatpond venture capitalist Dovey Wan, GXChain, a project which bills itself as “a fundamental blockchain for the global data economy”, has just come under pressure from the police. Citing videos presumably from Chinese social media, she wrote that the firm’s office has been “emptied out and sealed up”. Indeed, the video below shows an absence of employees in the office, multiple police stickers posted on the door, and a lack of company memorabilia in the front lobby.  Wan adds that according to her sources that are “close with the Hangzhou local police”, which preside over the area that GXChain’s main office is located in, the executives of the blockchain startup are being kept in custody “for interrogation”. According to Wan, GXChain’s legal run-in is surprising to her, as she believes that there are “10,000 other Chinese scams” that police could have addressed. Yet, she explains that the police may have cracked down on GXChain because it deals with personal credit data, which the cryptocurrency investor claims is a “highly sensitive business” in China now. Indeed, China has had some issues with its credit market over its history, presumably leading to the current move to crack down on those dealing in the industry. Due to this news, GXChain’s cryptocurrency has collapsed by some 30% in the past day, falling to a market capitalization of $35 million and nearly falling out of this market’s top 100 coins. The coin, GXC, is down to $0.56, from the $0.77 pre-police debacle. The shutdown of GXChain, which Dovey Wan claims was once a “hot ICO” with an actual business model, comes shortly after a number of odd debacles in the Chinese cryptocurrency scene. Of course, in August, a story about a Chinese Ponzi scheme came to the Western world. As reported by Blockonomi, the scam, PlusToken, purportedly managed to steal some  200,000 Bitcoin, 800,000 Ethereum, and a mass of other cryptocurrencies — all amounting to a fiat sum of over $3 billion — from nearly one million victims, most of which originated in the Asian region. Eventually, Chinese authorities crackdown, but there remain ringleaders at large. This was only one of many recent scams with operations in the region, however. Another scam tried to imitate Tron, using the name of the popular altcoin, to secure over $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies from thousand of gullible investors. Police are reported to have started investigating this case. While Chinese authorities aren’t too pleased with cryptocurrency projects not under their control, the People’s Bank of China is expected to soon launch its digital version of the yuan. A senior official at the central bank recently said that the project is ready to be rolled out, while sources told Forbes that the project is likely to be released to large Chinese enterprises before the launch of Libra and potentially before the end of the year.",

        "passage": "Earlier this week, cryptocurrency ransomware manager Coveware published a report on its official blog, revealing a staggering 90 percent increase in the incidence of ransomware payouts in the first quarter of 2019. For easier reference, ransomware is a form of computer malware that takes control of a host computer and leaves the user locked out. All access to the computer is completely cut off, and information stored on the computer’s hard disk remains inaccessible till a ransom is paid.  The report, which the company claimed was based on standard, real-time data, touched on the costs involved in a ransomware attack. The recovery costs (including any ransom paid to the attacker in order to avert the hack) and downtime costs (losses suffered as a result of the attack, usually measured in missed revenue opportunities and time lags). Coveware’s analysis went on to reveal that the average ransom paid to ransomware attackers was pegged at $12,762 for the first quarter in 2019. This figure represents an 89 percent increase from the $6,733 reported in the company’s Ransomware Marketplace Report for Q4 2018. The increase was mainly attributed to the rise in popularity of ransomware such as Ryuk, Iencrypt, and Bitpaymer; three of the recent malware developed and deployed in attacks on large corporations. The average ransomware downtime (the time needed to decrypt ransomware) increased to 7.3 days in Q1 2019. This is about 15 percent higher than the 6.2 percent reported in Q4 2018. Essentially, this means that ransomware attackers deployed more difficult-to-decrypt malware in 2019. The estimated downtime costs per ransomware per company was also revealed to be $65,645. The report revealed that Dharma, GandCarb, and Ryuk were the three most popular types of ransomware. However, the emphasis was laid primarily on Ryuk, as it has seen the highest increase in adoption levels amongst the top three. Decryption difficulty was pinned to be the single most prevalent cause of increased downtime, and Ryuk was highlighted to be one of the most challenging ransomware to decrypt. The professional services industry (which includes companies such as accounting agencies and law firms) was reported to be the most commonly-attacked ransomware victim. Even though they hold some highly valuable information (case files, tax records, account and banking details, settlement terms, etc.), these firms were reported to be notorious for under-investing in It security infrastructure. So, they’ve become easy prey for ransomware attackers. The average company size of ransomware victims increased from 71 employees in Q4 2018 to Q1 2019. This increase, as well as the estimated downtime cost, was also attributed to increases in Ryuk adoption. The ransomware is known for attacking mid-market and large enterprise with more capital and higher employee counts. However, while all of this paints a gloomy picture for cybersecurity, there seems to be hope on the horizon. Earlier last month, global payment processor PayPal filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a product which will help with the real-time detection of ransomware. The patent’s filing described a “technique for ransomware detection and mitigation,” and it will primarily detect the original copy of files and content on the host computer’s hard drive and collect the information. With the product, a user targeted in a ransomware attack would still have access to the original copy of the content, even if the ransomware already blocked access to the “altered version.” As the product hasn’t been released to the public yet, it is impossible to tell how it will fare against ransomware such as LockerGoga, Ryuk, and Dharma—the main culprits responsible for the increased profitability of ransomware attacks.",

        "passage": "Australia’s cryptocurrency tax laws contain some unfair provisions that will most often put crypto owners on the receiving end of huge tax burdens. These draconian tax laws also apply to tokens obtained via hard forks which has holders having to cough up substantial amounts in crypto tax payments. Even companies that pay staff salaries in virtual currencies may find little incentive to do so given the additional burden it incurs at the end of the year.  According to Australian cryptocurrency news platform Micky, a cryptocurrency holder was forced to pay a 500% tax on his digital holdings. Adrian Forza of Crypto Tax Australia told Micky that the country’s tax law stipulates that the value of cryptocurrency used for tax purposes comes from the purchase price. Thus, if an investor buys token X at $100 and the price depreciates to $10, the tax payment would be based on the $100 purchase price. Crypto tax in Australia stands at about 40% so that would mean paying a $40 tax on $10 worth of virtual currency. Commenting on the situation, Forza declared: Given the 2018 bear market that saw prices plummet by more than 80 percent across the board, virtual currency bag holders in Australia must have been made to pay unfair taxes. Usually, crypto tax laws for countries with such make it desirous to hold cryptocurrency for a long period of time. It is only in trading and making purchases that incur substantial tax implications. Forza also shed some light on other ridiculous provisions in Australia’s cryptocurrency tax regime. For one, the Australia Taxation Office (ATO) considers Ethereum Classic (ETC) to be the “original Ethereum” even though the cryptocurrency industry at large considers Ethereum (ETH) to be the original and ETC the fork. The implication of this tax ruling is that ETH holders have to pay capital gains tax on 100% of their ether holdings since the ATO considers the purchase price to be zero. Here is where the ATO appears to be disingenuous because when it comes to forks, it considers tokens obtained during the chain split to be bought as zero price. Thus, when tax season comes around, holders have to consider the current price. Another ridiculous tax law is one that subjects companies that pay employees in cryptos to “fringe benefits tax” to the tune of 47% on every dollar paid. This extra cost burden is most likely to disincentivize companies from paying their staff in bitcoin and other virtual currencies – a move which greatly hampers adoption. Since the ATO flipflops on when crypto should be valued for tax, it would be better to create a situation where holders can offset their losses during a bear market against the gains earned during the previous boom market. That way, the entire tax framework doesn’t become obscenely burdensome on cryptocurrency owners and traders. Another pain point is the refusal of the ATO to consider a fiat-in, fiat-out paradigm for its crypto taxation. Speaking to Micky, Jonathan Carley of DigitalX – a blockchain-based startup said that ATO will not adopt such a policy. These anti-crypto tax laws could severely damage the advancement of virtual currencies in the country. Crypto and blockchain technology continue to be a popular emerging market down under with exchanges like Zebpay moving to the country. Around the world, governments appear to be paying greater attention to crypto taxation especially with the current bull market in the hopes of earning internal revenue from traders. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says clear cut regulations are imminent.",

        "passage": "With buy pressure beginning to pick up in the space, the cryptoeconomy’s OG cryptocurrency is looking like it may be on the cusp of yet another bull market. That dynamic comes after the bitcoin price broke through $5,500 USD and popped up to as high as $5,636 on April 22nd for a gain of more than $250 on the day. That $5,636 valuation marked bitcoin’s highest price yet in 2019.  The BTC price is now up nine percent on the week, up 40 percent on the month, and up over 56 percent over the last three months. That green streak has been more sustained than any upward movements bitcoin had last year — a reality that has many crypto analysts wondering if the crypto’s longest bear market to date is officially over. For one, Wall Street crypto hopeful’s Fundstrat projected in their 2019 crypto outlook earlier this month that the bearish cycle that began in 2018 seemed to be waning. In their report, they noted: And, of course, the fabled “golden cross” has returned. A bullish technical indicator, a golden cross occurs when a “relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average,” per Investopedia. Regarding bitcoin’s current context, that means the coin’s 50-day moving price average has now crossed over its 200-day moving average. To that end, it’s the first time bitcoin has achieved such a cross since the fall of 2015 and further fuel for bullish speculation. Beyond the charts, optimism has generally been growing in the crypto ecosystem as of late on the heels of developments that have brought increased attention and activity: After the April 22nd price movement, the market capitalization of bitcoin is hovering just under $100 million. Chris Burniske, a partner at venture firm Placeholder, thinks that mark could reach $1 trillion once another cryptoeconomy bull run hits its stride, that would place Bitcoin over $50k per BTC.  Of course, that possibility is not necessarily unimaginable for crypto stakeholders who were around in 2017, when the bitcoin market cap ripped up to its last peak of $326.5 billion. Therefore the next bull run would need to triple the coin’s last top cap in order to hit the $1 trillion milestone — a climb, to be sure, but one that’s not unfathomable if enterprises participate in the next bull market in larger numbers. Bakkt, ErisX, and Fidiely Digital Assets are platforms meant to facilitate precisely such participation. So while it remains to be seen where the bitcoin price goes from here in the short-term, it’s clear that the crypto’s believers are as convinced as ever that the coin is primed for a bigger future. It’s had an impressive past, after all.  And while the past isn’t indicative of future performance, the trends of digitization and decentralization combined with bitcoin’s first-mover advantages suggest the crypto’s fabled rise toward the daylight of the mainstream is far from over yet.",

        "passage": "Galaxy Digital Holdings (GDH) was designed to be the first crypto merchant bank. Unfortunately for Mike Novogratz’s visionary project, falling crypto prices put a big hit of the value of GDH’s assets in Q1 this year. Mark-to-market losses for GDH’s crypto assets were in excess of $80 million USD, and actual trading losses helped to push total losses north of $130 million USD. Despite a terrible Q1, Mike Novogratz is optimistic. He had this to say in a statement after the financials for GDH were released: The $130 million USD loss that GDH sustained is substantial, as the bank’s assets were valued at around $280 million USD at the end of Q1. The vast majority of those assets are digital, which probably means cryptocurrencies or something similar. Mike Novogratz was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, and did very well during the massive rally over the last few years.  For the moment, GDH isn’t legally required to disclose their financials. Mike Novogratz has been talking about listing GDH on the TSX-V since last year, which would explain why GDH chose to release a pretty rough-looking financial statement. In order for GDH to list on the TSX-V, they have to disclose their financial position. If GDH is planning on going public via a reverse merger, they could be on the threshold of a new cycle of capital raising. Publicly traded companies usually have an easier time raising cash. With securities trading on the open market, GDH would be accessible to a much wider group of investors.  Mike Novogratz, Image from ToshiTimes The TSX-V has been a hotbed of crypto-related public listings. Last year saw the first ever listing of a Bitcoin miner, with HIVE Mining exploding in value. There have been a few more listings on the TSX-V this year. Hut-8 Mining is one of the more notable new listings, but none have created the returns that HIVE did when it hit a white-hot market last year. According to recent research, 2017 was an incredible year for returns in the crypto sector. The average crypto investment returned 136,000% during 2017, which is an amazingly high rate of return. In established markets a 10-15% return is very respectable, so the six digit percentage returns that cryptos delivered could be seen as overstretched. Last year Iota returned more than 600,000% to early investors, which is a staggeringly high rate of return. In most cases these companies are still revenue-negative, so much like the internet-bubble of the late 1990’s, some amount of caution is probably warranted in the sector. According to Mike Novogratz, widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies is still probably six or more years away. A recent poll discovered that only 2% of respondents in the US actually owned bitcoin, but this could be taken in numerous ways. For crypto bulls, the 2% figure could mean that there is a huge market waiting in the wings, but for the bears, it could just as easily be taken to mean that there is little public interest in the world’s most valuable crypto. The same poll showed that around 25% of the respondents were “intrigued” by Bitcoin. Given the returns that cryptos have produced in the last year or two, it would be nearly impossible for people to ignore the sector. Even with the ongoing downdraft in Bitcoin prices, it is still around 800% higher than it was when 2017 began. One of the biggest problems for the emerging crypto sector is the nature of a token. Unlike equity or debt, a token isn’t really ownership of anything. Owning a token is more or less the same thing as securing access to a blockchain, which isn’t something that fits into the established financial worldview. Many in the crypto sector have been waiting for the established financial system to invest in cryptos, but this may not be what pushes cryptos forward. The value that adoption and widespread use of cryptos could create is hard to imagine. As cryptos are really a form of tokenized access, it is possible that instead of price, adoption and use should be the first metrics that are looked at when the health of cryptocurrencies is examined.",

        "passage": "Cryptopia, the New Zealand-based Bitcoin exchange hacked in January 2019 is shutting down for good and going into liquidation. A couple of liquidators from Grant Thornton have already been tasked with the job of security assets belonging to stakeholders of the company. Cryptopia joins others like Mt. Gox in failing to recover from a cyber attack. Meanwhile, experts continue to warn cryptocurrency traders to recognize the risks associated with participating in the market.  According to the NZ Herald, Russell Moore and David Roscoe of Grant Thornton will be in charge of overseeing the liquidation process. Cryptopia lost close to $23 million in cryptocurrency from the January 2019 heist. An excerpt from a statement issued by Roscoe reads: The statement goes on further to say that a resolution to the matter might take months given the “complexities involved.” The liquidators say there are working with independent experts to ascertain the full extent of Cryptopia’s obligations to its creditors. The January 2019 hack appears to have impacted the platform significantly to the extent that it may not be able to recover. The top hierarchy at the company reportedly tried to downsize its staff strength but despite running a skeleton crew, Cryptopia couldn’t return to profitable business operations. On Tuesday (May 14, 2019), the company informed shareholders of its decision to shut down. The Cryptopia premises in Sydenham, Christchurch is also under lock and key with reports saying the building looks like a ghost town. As previously reported by Blockonomi, the platform had tried to resume services, starting in early March 2019 with a read-only website. At the time, users reported that they were being subject to a “haircut” on their cryptocurrency holdings as the platform tried to recover from the loss. Cryptopia now joins Mt. Gox and QuadrigaCX to name a few, as cryptocurrency exchanges forced to shut down following financial difficulties. Back in 2014, the now-defunct Tokyo-based MT. Gox suffered a devastating hack of almost $500 million in Bitcoin and never recovered. At the time, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world but now is undergoing civil rehabilitation to pay off creditors affected in the hack. For QuadrigaCX, the situation is a little more bizarre. Gerald Cotten, the CEO of the company passed away without handing over the keys to the platform’s cold wallets to his next-of-kin. Once Canada’s largest Bitcoin exchange platform, QuadrigaCX is also pursuing a similar course of action to Cryptopia. Whether on account of hacking, unfriendly government policies, poor business practices or some other extenuating set of circumstances, cryptocurrency exchanges run the risk of going out of business. For these reasons, many experts say traders need to exercise caution when trading virtual currencies on these platforms. The absence of deposit-guarantee by many exchanges means that traders run the risk of losing their investments should anything go wrong. The establishment of trusted cryptocurrency custodians and insurers could go a long way in diminishing these risk factors. Fidelity Investments has plans to providing robust cryptocurrency custodial tools even as it gears up to begin offering Bitcoin trading to its institutional clients. Cryptocurrency startups like Coinbase and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle also have their own custody platforms. Bakkt, the cryptocurrency derivatives platform owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) also reportedly wants to become a licensed virtual currency custodian.",

        "passage": "Brad Sherman seems to be a fierce opponent of cryptocurrency. He recently made numerous public comments on cryptos, but they can all be summed up by this telling quote, The idea that cryptos are solely used for malfeasance is, of course, preposterous. Any negotiable instrument can be used for legal, or illegal transactions. Today cryptocurrency can be used much in the same way that fiat currency that is created by central banks is used. The one big problem for bank-backed politicians like Brad Sherman is that cryptos cut out the intermediaries. As Brad Sherman mistakenly asserts, “there is nothing that can be done with cryptocurrency that cannot be done with sovereign currency.” This is a blatantly false statement from a man that is directly supported by third-party settlement companies. Cryptocurrency can be used for things that, “sovereign currency,” simply can’t.  An Argentine bank, Banco Masventas, proved this when they replaced SWIFT with Bitcoin. Instead of submitting to a payment system that is controlled by the global central banks, Banco Masventas uses Bitcoin to make large, international currency transfers. This new use for Bitcoin is far cheaper than SWIFT, and accomplishes the transaction in a day. In a sense Brad Sherman is right, the SWIFT system almost never allows for transactions with sovereign currency to be made quickly. Like many things in the established financial system, SWIFT has gotten by with a de-facto monopoly for decades, and now that looks like it could be changing. No one in their right mind would assert that cryptocurrency offers nothing in addition to central bank created fiat currency. It should come as no surprise that Brad Sherman’s largest campaign donations in his last reelection bid came from Allied Wallet, which is a credit card payment processor. In other words, one of the industries that is most at-risk from cryptocurrency adoption at a consumer level. When a crypto investor who goes by the name of “CryptoDog” on Twitter mentioned this connection between Brad Sherman and Allied wallet to the Twitterverse, he was promptly told to, “STOP,” by none other than Brad Sherman himself. Clearly, Brad Sherman seems a little touchy about the potential for pay-for-play allegations.   Unfortunately for Congressman Sherman, statements like this make his opinions look very compromised It has been pointed out many, many times that currencies like the US Dollar can be used for illegal purposes. Pretty any medium of exchange can be used by criminals, but the US banking system is equally likely to engage in corrupt, illegal acts that help to support terrorism and fraud. The US Government takes a harsh view of Iran, and yet, under President Obama they transferred more than a billion US dollars to Iran, in cash. Iran has been identified by the US government as a state sponsor of terrorism, which makes this massive cash transaction look pretty strange. Given how easy it is to pick up a nuclear warhead in Bulgaria, the entire sideshow around the Iranian nuclear program is deranged, now that Iran has so many US dollars sitting around. There are also multiple instances of major money center banks like JP Morgan helping to launder money, and numerous other illegal acts. The amount of money that JP Morgan has paid in federal fines under CEO Jamie Dimon is in the tens of billions of USD, which would suggest no small amount of wrongdoing on their part. Part of the reason why cryptocurrencies may be so popular with the younger generations is the level of dishonesty that is present in major governments. It would be hard to take anything that Brad Sherman says about cryptocurrencies seriously, given his connections to banking, and obvious hate for an incredible new technology.",

        "passage": "The hierarchy at Facebook is reportedly alive to the possibility that its flagship cryptocurrency project, Libra, may not get off the ground. Financial regulators and government authorities in multiple jurisdictions have expressed concerns over the possible launch of the digital currency. Some commentators say the social media giant should jettison its plans for a bespoke digital payment gateway in favor of acquiring a company like Square that has already had great success in obtaining relevant regulatory clearances.  Facebook has come out to issue a dire warning that the Libra project may not take off following the current state of the regulatory climate for cryptocurrency businesses. In its recently released quarterly report, the social media behemoth said it had plans to launch Libra in 2020 but such designs may not see the light of day. An excerpt from the company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reads: As previously reported by Blockonomi, there has been massive regulatory pushback against the Libra project since Facebook released the white paper. Almost everyone from members of the U.S. Congress to regulators in Europe, Asia, and Africa have expressed concerns over the project. Libra was even the subject of Congressional hearings as lawmakers sought to gain a better understanding of the industry. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and even the country’s President Donald Trump weighed in with negative comments about the project. Facebook for its part says it will the necessary steps to gain regulatory approval for Libra. The company highlighted the changing regulatory environment for the digital sphere which places more burden on tech companies to prove that their products do not pose systemic risks. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg even spoke about Facebook’s commitment to scaling all the regulatory hurdles saying: Meanwhile, some stakeholders in the U.S. believe that regulatory conditions in the country are net negative for America’s place in the emerging digital landscape. Critics of the patchwork of rules and guidelines say innovation is being driven away from the U.S. to other jurisdictions with fairer cryptocurrency and blockchain technology laws. Given the magnitude of the regulatory hurdles set before Facebook in launching Libra, some commentators say the company would do well to abandon the project and focus on other less controversial digital payment methods. Earlier in July, CNBC’s Jim Cramer advised the company to ditch Libra and instead acquire Jack Dorsey’s Square. Rather than trying to build a digital payment system, Cramer says Facebook should buy Square and expand the company’s operations. As previously reported by Blockonomi, Square recently launched bitcoin deposit integration on the platform. Dorsey for his part continues to be a staunch bitcoin proponent.",

In a recent release, Standard Chartered announced they would be working with German conglomerate Siemens’ financing arm Siemens Financial Services (SFS), and trade finance platform TradeIX to create a blockchain-based system for bank guarantees.  The new system will: According to Samuel Mathew commented, who is Standard Chartered’s global head of trade products. Mr. Mathew went on to say that,“The future of trade is going to be all about data,” which means that more blockchain platforms could be working their way out of the banking system at any time. Bank guarantees aren’t a part of most consumer’s lives, but they are a vital part of the global economy. Much like letters of credit, or other forms of trade finance, bank guarantees are a financial product that is ready for change. This isn’t the first major initiative by a group of financial institutions that seeks to revamp an inefficient system using blockchain. Standard Chartered is also working with a consortium of the largest banks in Asia, to create a new platform that would change how trade finance happens. TradeIX CEO Rob Barnes belives that Which is probably why numerous banks are working on ways to spearhead blockchain development programs. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced last month that Standard Chartered would be one of the banks involved with their new trade finance platform, which is based on a blockchain architecture developed by PingAn. The backbone of the system that PingAn developed is already in use, and has created advantages for the entire trade finance ecosystem in mainland China.  Read: Hong Kong HKMA Works With Ping An to Create Blockchain Trade Finance Platform Unlike traditional trade finance, PingAn’s platform offers benefits for both banks and their clients. The platform they created also makes creating merchant accounts much easier, due to its high level of automation. The end result of this is a wider range of potential borrowers, and more oversight for the lending entities within the trade finance market. A string of news reports earlier this year suggested that the R3 consortium was running out of money, which was immediately refuted by the company. R3 is a private organization, so their financials are not accessible to the public. Whatever their current capital position, their Corda architecture is in demand. This announcement from Standard Chartered comes on the heels of a similar announcement from Thailand’s Central Bank, who is reportedly using Corda to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). R3 has been working to tailor Corda to businesses’ needs, and released a version last month that was specifically created to address privacy concerns. Many of the members of the R3 consortium are financial institutions, and have to adhere to strict regulations when it comes to data privacy. Richard Gendal Brown, the CTO at R3, commented publicly after the release of the new version of Corda, Mr. Brown’s views would appear to be accurate, based on the recent announcement from Siemens, Standard Chartered, and TradeIX. Corda was also employed by Ernst and Young, Guardtime and Maersk, for another platform that would address insurance for global logistics. Whether or not there will be overlap between all of these Corda-based systems is unknown, but hopefully synergy is being designed into all of these platforms that deal with similar businesses.",

        "passage": "Enjin’s new Blockchain Software Development Kit (SDK) for Unity could be the start of some big changes in how games are designed. Unity already has a massive developer base of more than 4 million game designers. Enjin has created a new way to use Ethereum-based ERC-1155 tokens that may be a perfect fit for the gaming world. ERC-1155 have some interesting characteristics. Enjin thinks they will be useful to game developers because Ethereum-based ERC-1155 tokens can be made in both fungible and non- fungible varieties in unlimited quantities with a single smart contract. They are also a lot ‘cheaper’ to use and probably won’t choke up the Ethereum network like ERC-721 tokens have.  If that paragraph sounded like technical jargon, no problem. In plain English, Enjin’s ERC-1155 tokens will allow game developers to create items that can be either identical or unique and can also be traded with the reliability and transparency that blockchain creates. Modern games use countless items in their game design and game developers haven’t had the ability to collaborate by allowing items to be shared between different companies’ platforms. Until now, the logistics of creating multi-platform game items wasn’t a straightforward process. With the new SDK from Enjin, that is changing. Imagine being able to use a token from one game in another, or trade it for cryptocurrencies. Enjin’s new SDK isn’t the only platform that could make this dream a reality, but it is being introduced to one of the largest game development communities on the planet. Online gaming has become a massive global industry, but it is still controlled by a few big players. The centralized developers set the rules and you little or no input in how they are applied to the games. Blockchain-based tokens could change the way that games are developed and played. Instead of being limited to one game or ‘universe’ (developer), gamers could use their items across multiple games, or other areas online.  In addition to the new blockchain SDK that Enjin just announced, they will be launching full support for their EnjinX blockchain explorer that was first announced last month. Until now, authenticating blockchain items has only been possible been for people with heavy technical skills. New explorer platforms like EnjinX will be needed to bridge the gap between the tech-heavy blockchain community and regular gamers who want easy access to blockchain data. The way that people interface with each other is changing, and Enjin looks like it is taking a pole position in the race to integrate blockchain with gaming. It would be a mistake to underestimate how much potential there is in the blockchain gaming market, or what could be created with these new tools. Enjin already has more than 30 games and platforms that using its technology to create interoperable items that can be used across what they call “The Multiverse”. The potential for larger adoption of this technology is very real. Unity is used to create games for just about every popular platform there is, including PlayStation and Android. As successes like Pokemon GO have demonstrated, a popular idea can spread across the globe in a matter of days. If people around the world could exchange items with each other, or buy unique items for a broad-based global gaming experience, the platform would take global gaming interconnectivity to the next level. Enjin will be demoing its new technology and giving the public a chance to play around in the Multiverse at GDC later this month, which drew in excess of 25,000 attendees last year. Blockchain has the ability to change many established industries. Gaming might not be the first one to come to mind, but Enjin is creating the tools which could create a new era in gaming. The blockchain integration into gaming is still just getting started, and Enjin is definitely a company that is worth watching.",

The partnership would create more awareness for the crypto project and also bring cryptocurrency and blockchain technology closer to the people. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are gradually gaining widespread acceptance among different sectors, and the sports industry seems to be appreciating the many benefits associated with the dynamic industry.  According to a press release by the National Basketball Association (NBA) on Monday (July 15, 2019), Cleveland Cavaliers (the Cavs) NBA 2k league, Cavs Legion, collaborated with cryptocurrency firm, UnitedCoin. The partnership would see Cavs Legion adopt UnitedCoin as its official cryptocurrency partner. Also, the alliance among the trio would create more publicity for UnitedCoin and provide the professional basketball team the means to capitalize on the fintech sector via cryptocurrency. In addition, in the NBA 2k League, the United Coin logo will be displayed on the home court of the Cavs League during gameplay. Also, the team would push UnitedCoin on all its social media handles. Commenting on the partnership, Cleveland Cavaliers’ President of Business Operations, Nic Barlage, said that the reason for collaborating with the cryptocurrency company was to stay abreast of happenings in the dynamic industry and create a better avenue for its fans. Furthermore, Barlage said: Derek Jones, Co-founder and CEO of UnitedCoin also saw the coalition as an avenue to bring cryptocurrency and blockchain technology closer to fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cavs Legion and also enlighten them on the benefits of cryptocurrency. Additional details about the partnership include LED signage inside the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the arena of the basketball team, during the games, and branding opportunities in the forthcoming 2019-20 season. There has been an increasing healthy partnership between the sports industry and the cryptocurrency sector. Blockonomi recently reported the collaboration between American football team, Miami Dolphins and Litecoin. According to the report, the team adopted Litecoin as its official cryptocurrency. Also, Portuguese football club, S.L. Benfica, became the first major European football team to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method, following its partnership with the cryptocurrency payment platform, Utrust. The collaboration enables Benfica fans to purchase merchandise and tickets using bitcoin, ether, and Utrust’s token, UTK. In December 2018, Litecoin announced the sponsorship of an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event that took place on December 29, 2018. Per the report at the time, the litecoin was leveraging on the millions of UFC viewers to promote cryptocurrency. Apart from partnerships and sponsorships between the nascent industry and the sports sector, there have also been cases of players being paid in crypto. Back in early 2018, Ted-Jan Bloemen, a skater, became the first Olympian to be paid in cryptocurrency. Also, Gibraltar United F.C., a Premier Division of the Gibraltar Football league, entered into a partnership that included payment of players’ salaries in cryptocurrency. While some players are getting paid in cryptocurrency courtesy of their clubs, some prominent players in the National Football League (NFL) are trying hard to get the league to pay them in crypto. Matt Barkley, Quarterback for Buffalo Bills, wanted the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals to pay his contract in bitcoin. The quarterback later revealed via Twitter that he was already mining bitcoin. Another NFL player, Russell Okung, also made a request on Twitter to be paid in bitcoin.",

        "passage": "The official manufacturer behind leading cryptocurrency hardware wallet Trezor has announced that it believes criminals are using a new method to steal funds from unsuspecting victims. The post, released on Medium by Satoshi Labs, the company behind the Trezor brand, stated that they have been made aware that “one-to-one copies” of Trezor are circulating the market. As the post states, “In other words, a fake Trezor device, manufactured by a different, unknown vendor” has been discovered. SatoshiLabs continue to add that whilst Trezor clones have been operating in the market for some time now, not only do they are utilize a different brand name, but they are also manufactured by legitimate organizations. As such, the process of distinguishing between a real Trezor and a clone is a simple one. However, a new breed of fake Trezor’s have been discovered.  They are believed to be practically identical to the original product, much in the same way that counterfeit apparel products attempt to deceive loyal brand purchasers. Much like in the case of counterfeit apparel products, the unknown manufacturer is offering their fake Trezor at a price vastly lower that the original. The Trezor team add that on top of a significantly lower price tag, it is also possible to ascertain whether you might have a fake device by looking at the product’s attached hologram. By uploading images and a video, the post allows users to check their hologram to ensure they have a legitimate product.  As the Trezor team have only recently been made aware of the illicit flood of fakes, it is yet to be acknowledged how many are currently circulating. The key concern for those affected is what capabilities the seller has regarding stored funds.  Under normal circumstances, Trezor devices (along with other leading hardware devices) are the most secure way of protecting yourself against the threats of external malpractice. Even if the device was subsequently lost, or worse, stolen, then the thief would still have limited, if any access to the victim’s funds. The key reason for this is that in order to facilitate a movement of funds out of the wallet, the user is required to enter a physical PIN number that was set by the owner of the device. Furthermore, each subsequently incorrect PIN combination activates the time-lock, meaning the user has to wait a certain amount of time before they can try again. Brute force would simply render the device redundant. During this time, the victim would have the ability to recover their funds remotely, by using their back-up passphrase.  Read: Trezor vs Ledger Review However, if the aforementioned fake Trezor devices are as innovative as the physical design of the product, then there could be further complications. One such possibility is that the illicit manufacturer creates the device in such a manner that allows them to remotely access the user’s balance. This could be extremely costly, especially when one considers that hardware devices are generally used for larger cryptocurrency holdings. Nevertheless, this should be a stark reminder to those looking to get a cheap deal on hardware wallet devices. As echoed by the manufacturers themselves, you should only ever buy a Trezor device from an official channel. In most cases, this is either directly from the Trezor website or via an officially licensed third party, such as Amazon. The Trezor product has grown significantly since its launch in 2014, selling over a million devices along the way. It remains to be seen whether the announcement will instill fear in future buyers.",

Hyperledger and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) announced they would be working together to the benefit of blockchain technology as a whole on Monday. The two groups have been viewed as rivals in the past, but it looks like they are teaming up so that industrial blockchain uses can grow unimpeded.  EEA executive director, Ron Resnick, said that, The deal that Hyperledger and the EEA struck seems to be simple enough. Both groups have joined the opposite organization, which should help blockchain technology develop faster. The newly opened doors will allow both members from both groups to freely share information, and tap into synergies that exist between the two groups. Blockchain developers are more or less free from regulations. On the face of it this freedom is ok, but from an industrial standpoint, there is little to ensure that a company is buying into a quality product. That is where the EEA comes into the picture. Now Hyperledger developers can access the EEA’s certification programs, and easily show their platforms fit into some of the best blockchain standards that have been created so far.  Read: Hyperledger: Open Source Blockchain Project Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger’s executive director seems to understand the advantages that will come out of this tie-up. He said this in a statement, “Great open standards depend upon great open source code, so this is a natural alliance for both organizations.” EEA members will also be able to work directly with Hyperledger platform developers, and gain insight into how to implement standards as a project evolves. Amber Baldet, has a history of working with both groups. She is also the founder of Clovyr, and former blockchain lead at JPMorgan Chase who has been closely involved in both groups. Ms. Baldet pointed out to Forbes that, Anything that the blockchain community can do to help industry adopt a steady view of DLT is probably wise. IBM has had an easy time selling major companies on their blockchain technology, which is based in Hyperledger architecture. There is no reason why IBM’s platform is inherently better than any other developer’s version of Hyperledger, but without firmly established industry standards, it is tough for smaller companies to compete with an entity like Big Blue. The new level of cooperation between EEA and Hyperledger will feature an open source codebase that anyone in either group will have access to. There will also be a third-party standards organization which will make certification easier for smaller companies that want to develop novel Hyperledger technology. IBM’s take on Hyperledger was recently sold to Walmart as a solution for tracking food in its massive logistics system. It is telling that a relatively recent innovation like DLT can be realistically used to replace vital record keeping systems, with a lead time that is measured in months. Pilot programs like the one that Walmart and IBM are rolling out will help to shore up confidence in blockchain, as long as it is successful. The fact that Hyperledger is being used by Walmart and IBM could be a big benefit to smaller developers as time goes on. A new level of cooperation between Hyperledger and EEA could help the next generation of blockchain developers to connect with larger companies, and demonstrate they are using solid code that will be able to adapt to a changing global environment for data sharing.",

        "passage": "Litecoin creator Charlie Lee has been known for his occasional controversial statement on Twitter. Today was no different as Lee has raised the ire of the Stellar community with a backhanded compliment. Reactions on Twitter were mixed, but generally the community did not appear to be in support of Lee’s assertion that Stellar Lumens does not deserve its market cap since it is not a mined currency.  So what did Lee say, exactly? Here is Lee’s original Tweet from earlier that has already collected over 500 comments:  Basically speaking, he congratulated Stellar, but suggested that due to the fact that Stellar Lumens are not mined through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, that they are somehow less deserving of their valuation and consequent market cap. Further, in response to a number of comments left to the Tweet, Lee suggested that only cryptocurrencies that are distributed through a mining reward of some type are truly decentralized. This is the same methodology employed by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. In the original bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto states that utilizing a block reward to distribute the currency will help to ensure a wider distribution – as opposed to a centralized model such as a central bank. Stellar Lumens, on the other hand, are not mined and were instead issued by the Stellar Foundation. In order to distribute the tokens, Steller performed what is essentially an airdrop and gave away a large portion of the available Lumens for free. Today, Lumens are distributed through a process the group calls inflation which again releases them without a monetary or computational cost. Lee saw quite a backlash for his comment and suggested that Stellar Lumens and other non-mined cryptocurrencies like XRP do not deserve their market cap. Here are a few examples of the shade thrown at Lee in response to his “complement”.    For the last 18 months, LTC has seemed to be a highly solid asset with a clear trajectory and use case. That being, since bitcoin fees were too high, Litecoin was the cryptocurrency of choice for spending. Now, Litecoin has seen a number of new and highly nimble competitors come onto the scene like Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ethereum Classic, and many other popular choices that offer even lower transaction fees than Litecoin. What’s worse is that Litecoin mining has arguably become highly centralized due to the Chinese company Bitmain being the only serious supplier of Scrypt-compatible miners, and that Bitmain operates its own Litecoin industrial scale mining operation.  Litecoin creator poses for photo with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu Even Charlie Lee himself has been accused of centralizing Litecoin when he infamously sold all of his LTC holdings when the asset was at its all-time high of well over $300 each. But it’s not all doom and gloom for the once number three asset. Litecoin has recently partnered with TokenPay in the purchase of a large piece of a German bank, as well as a handful of other groundbreaking partnerships that could prove to help keep Litecoin relevant and evolving. Litecoin prices recently have been steady between the $70-$90 range, so from a monetary perspective, Litecoin seems secure for the time being. But the Litecoin Foundation will undoubtedly need to keep working hard in order to make sure this asset doesn’t become irrelevant in the face of some steep competition. Images via @SatoshiLite",

        "passage": "To most in the crypto community, mainstream media is viewed with intense skepticism.  Most of these attacks come from mainstream outlets, from CNBC and Forbes to the New York Post and Bloomberg. For instance, one Bloomberg op-ed headline published in January 2018 reads: “Sorry, Bitcoin Fans. Digital Currency Is Still a Dream.” But, Bitcoin and its devout followers may have found a mainstream media “inside man”, so to speak, that is heading one of CNBC’s top shows.  The anchor’s name is Joe Kernen, a panelist and showrunner at CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, the station’s morning Wall Street show. Ever since Facebook’s unveiled Libra, their soon-to-launch pseudo-centralized stablecoin, Kernen has come to an understanding of Bitcoin almost like he has had some sort of epiphany. It all started last week, which was when the “Squawk Box” correspondents began to cover news of the Silicon Valley-backed cryptocurrency. As many were claiming that this was a “cryptocurrency”, Kernen rebutted. The television star questioned Libra’s “inherent value”, discussing the fact that it will just be based on the United States Dollar and similar assets in that class. Kernen even hinted at his mistrust of fiat monies, noting that the only thing backing paper currencies is the governments and central banks, then adding that the European Union leaders have begun to debase (inflate) the Euro. And to put a cherry on the proverbial Bitcoin cake, he made the argument that a “real Bitcoin” may have more value than Libra due to the former’s decentralized blockchain.  Following the airing of this segment, Crypto Twitter, including many prominent executives and commentators, quickly lauded Kernen. Due to his newfound knowledge of cryptocurrency, Kernen continued his Bitcoin crusade the day later. After briefly calling himself a “Bitcoin bull” and a “god” of sorts, the Squawk Box personality quipped: On Monday, Kernen took the time to bash Libra for the umpteenth time. After Bart Smith of Susquehanna laid out his thoughts on why Libra isn’t a cryptocurrency, the “Squawk Box” host then said something that was music to the ears of cypherpunks across the globe. Sounding like a Satoshi Nakamoto excerpt, Kernen explained that Libra is a currency for corporations, but Bitcoin is a currency built and used by “the people”. This small yet notable comment confirms, according to Barry Silbert, that Kernen has entered the “five phases of Bitcoin acceptance”: dismissive, skeptical, intellectually curious, believer, and evangelist.  To CNBC’s credit, the entire organization isn’t filled with seemingly anti-crypto commentators. On CNBC Africa, there’s Ran NeuNer, an early crypto investor and venture capitalist, that runs “Crypto Trader”, an occasional one-hour segment that covers conferences, price action, and news events in this budding industry. And on the “Fast Money” and “Futures Now” segments, CNBC brings on well-known analysts, like Tom Lee and Brian Kelly, some of which have a good understanding of the space. With this new knowledge that Kernen and his peers know more than they previously let on, many in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are hoping that CNBC can begin to take more balanced approaches towards this space. Whether or not this happens remains to be seen, however.",

        "passage": "Lionel Messi – the Barcelona playmaker that is often described as the most naturally talented Soccer player of all time, is to endorse the world’s first blockchain mobile phone, as reported by UK newspaper The Independent. The organization behind the project, Swiss-Israeli-startup Sirin Labs, claim to specialize in multi-layer cyber security through the utilization of blockchain technology. The smartphone, which is labeled as the “Finney”, is supported by a Google Certified fork of Android, which it calls Sirin OS. On top of having the underlying technology secured by blockchain technology, the Finney handset will also will also have a cold wallet application that allows users to safely store their cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the in-built Sirin app store will facilitate a range of decentralized applications (dApps). One such example is a dApp that will allow Finney users to exchange mobile data or battery power in return for digital tokens.  The Finney is set for an official launch date of November 29th, with an estimated price-tag of $1,000. Sirin Labs have already had success in the smartphone space, with the 2016 launch of their “Solarin”. The device, which was at the time labeled as the “world’s most secure phone“, retailed for a substantial $16,000. The Solarin project also had an A-list celebrity tie, with both Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio attending the London premier launch event. With the endorsement of Messi – who by the way, has just under 90 million Facebook followers, is excellent news for the cryptocurrency industry, insofar that it further supports the long-term goal of mass awareness. However, it is also important to note that the marketing strategy of employing a celebrity to endorse a blockchain-related project does not necessarily guarantee success. For example, in late 2017, Floyd Mayweather, who is often dubbed as the best “Pound-for-Pound” boxer of all time, endorsed the now defunct initial coin offering of Centra Coin. The project – which claimed to provide a gateway for users to spend cryptocurrencies via a Visa or MasterCard backed debit card, raised close to $32 million before being shut down by U.S. regulators. It remains to be seen how much money the project would have raised without the endorsement of Mayweather, however it is highly likely that his link to the ICO created an element of artificial legitimacy. Then there was the case of John McAfee, the controversial founder of McAfee anti-virus software. McAfee recently admitted that he charged close to $100,000 to Tweet support for up and coming cryptocurrency projects, subsequently motivating unsuspecting individuals to invest in the recommended token. Nevertheless, recognizing the slightly dampened history of celebrity endorsed blockchain projects, the team at Sirin Labs state that “If you’ve followed Messi’s career at all, you’d know he doesn’t just put his name on anything to make a buck,” Announcements such as the Finney product further illustrates the fact that although the cryptocurrency markets have been somewhat bearish since the turn of late 2017, much is going on behind the scenes. Whilst the value of most cryptocurrency portfolios are worth a fraction of what they were just 12 months prior, blockchain entities are churning out new and exciting ventures across multiple industries, indicating that the phenomenon is far from a short-term fad. However, it remains to be seen just how long global adoption will take, especially when one considers the vast amount of projects now in existence. Sirin Labs raised more than $157 million during their late-2017 ICO, with $110 million of this  received in the first 24 hours. However, as with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, the Sirin Labs token has lost the vast majority of its value since it was issued. Reaching a remarkable all-time high of just over $320 million at the start of the year, the token currently has a total market capitalization of $18 million.",

        "passage": "Chinese mining giant Bitmain launched a new cryptocurrency index fund on Friday, November 30, 2018 with the goal of attracting institutional investors to the cryptocurrency space, which executive believe have been relatively inactive in the market.  The new service features real-time spot prices for several cryptocurrencies, which according to Bitmain, will be updated every second of each day. This means that the slightest change will be recorded to ensure customers are always in the know. Second, there is a reference price published at approximately 10 a.m. in Hong Kong every day. The index will also feature the spot prices of the industry’s top 17 cryptocurrencies. Aside from this fund, Bitmain has also announced plans to launch the Crypto Large Cap 10 Index (BLC 10). Executives claim that this index will track baskets of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Customers can also look forward to updates every second through this platform. In a press release, Bitmain explains: November has been something of a mixed month for Bitmain, and the company has seen its fair share of controversy over the past 30 days. Early in the month, Bitmain filed suit against an anonymous hacker that executives claimed had stolen approximately $5.5 million from the company’s cryptocurrency wallets. Court documents allege that the hacker ultimately gained access to the company’s digital wallets and moved crypto funds to his own personal accounts, later selling them at above market prices and garnering a hefty fortune. The suit was filed in a U.S. district court in Washington. Prosecutors allege that the hacker knowingly behaved in a way that ultimately wronged and injured Bitmain’s business operations. However, the company was later slapped with a class-action suit from approximately 100+ customers who had bought Bitmain’s assorted crypto miners. The plaintiffs alleged that the company had secretly set up the miners to extract new cryptocurrency units and move them into the company’s own crypto wallet accounts by default. The setup and configuration processes for Bitmain’s miners are reported to take anywhere between several hours to several days to complete, which potentially gave Bitmain a huge window to mine cryptocurrency unnoticed. The plaintiffs are suing the company for over $5 million to cover their electricity costs and legal fees. The court filing for the case reads: Bitmain isn’t the only company that has sought to create a benchmark price for cryptocurrencies. The Finance Magnates Intelligence Department has also worked to develop a cryptocurrency performance benchmark, which allegedly measures the present conditions of the main cryptocurrency markets. The platform consists of the four largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (bitcoin, ether, XRP and bitcoin cash) and consistently tracks their price changes, giving readers updated information on their favorite coins regularly and throughout the day. In September of 2017, the benchmark boasted an initial value of roughly 5,000 points.",

        "passage": "Using borrowed money to speculate on the financial markets is a risky activity. Most investors don’t have good risk management skills, and have a hard time understanding how quickly a position can wipe out their capital. New regulations from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will make leveraged trading safer for everyone. Since macro-trading first became popular for retail traders in the late 1990’s, there have been a lot of new brokers popping up around the world. Many of them offer leverage of up to 500:1, which means that for every 1 unit of currency, the broker will give the client 500 units to trade with. It is easy to be blinded by dreams of making a lot of money quickly with borrowed money. More often then not, leveraged retail accounts end up going bust, or even owing the broker money from a losing position that the trader held for too long.  The ESMA recently announced that effective from July 30 of this year, there will be a number of changes for any broker who is regulated by EU laws, and offers leveraged investment products to retail investors. The bottom line is that the amount of leverage that brokers can offer is dropping, which means that investors won’t be able to take on the same amount of risk. The new regulations state that the initial margin to open a position can’t be lower than 20:1, and that CFDs that represent commodities and indices will also be subject to much lower levels of leverage. These new laws will apply to just about any leveraged product, including CFDs and FOREX trading. The new ESMA regulations will also prohibit any kind of offer that incentivizes trading, and will require that brokers close out positions when a client runs out of margin. When macro trading first came on the scene in the 1970s, only professional traders had access to the markets that allowed speculation in FOREX and commodities. That has changed over the last 20 years. Now, just about anyone can open up an account at a broker who will give them high levels of leverage. Many regulators require that brokers disclose the percentage of their clients who lose money. In most cases, retail FOREX traders and CFD traders lose money (usually around 80%). The real problem comes in when a trader doesn’t understand how to use stop loss orders, or takes a ‘buy and hold’ mentality with a highly leveraged trade. The new ESMA regulations will remove many of these risks from the EU’s leveraged investment market, and put anyone who deals with an EU regulated broker in a much safer position. While the new regulations that ESMA is putting in place are probably a great idea for any trader (using 500:1 leverage is financial suicide) there are still numerous brokers that are outside of the EU who will offer their clients high levels of leverage. It is a very good idea for any trader to understand how to limit their losses, and not get into a position where a single trade wipes their entire account out in a matter of minutes. Great macro traders like Paul Tudor Jones put a large emphasis on risk management, which is something everyone can benefit from. The new ESMA regulations seem to be taking this trading philosophy to heart, and making sure retail brokers in the EU offer their clients an attractive risk/reward profile.",

        "passage": "It appears Americans are losing faith in cryptocurrencies, and trust in the space is at an all-time low. A new survey suggests that approximately 41 percent of Americans – nearly half – will never invest in digital money.  One of the major problems with bitcoin and its altcoins cousins is volatility. Prices can swing up just as easily as they can swing down, and over the last two weeks, most investors have witnessed this firsthand. Bitcoin, for example, had risen to approximately $8,200 by mid-July, giving many enthusiasts cause for celebration. It was only a week later that things began to move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin began dropping quickly, and before long, all the July progress it had made was wiped from the slate. At press time, the currency is trading for roughly $6,300 – about $2,000 less than where less than half-a-month ago. From there, many altcoins began following in the currency’s footsteps. When bitcoin falls, others usually fall with it, and this time around was no exception. Ethereum – the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the number one competitor to bitcoin – is now trading at roughly $353. This is about $50 less than where it stood just last week, which in turn, was roughly $100 less than the position it held in mid-July. Ripple, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, is down by 16 percent, while Litecoin, the seventh-largest crypto by market cap, has fallen by more than nine percent.  Read: Bitcoin Price Falls Drastically After Bitcoin ETF Decision is Postponed Naturally, this takes a toll on investors’ outlooks, and cryptocurrency is losing the respect and attention it held during last year’s December rally. A poll conducted by the cryptocurrency app Gem and analytics firm Harris Insights recorded the answers of approximately 2,000 American adults. Of the individuals surveyed, only eight percent claimed to hold cryptocurrencies in their investment portfolios. It appears cryptocurrency still isn’t as popular as traditional stock options, which are held by approximately 52 percent of American adults according to a Gallup poll from 2016. In addition, those who did not hold crypto admit that they are simply not interested, and that nothing could ever “motivate them to invest in digital assets.” It’s a disappointing outcome, considering all bitcoin enthusiasts want is for the currency to hit mainstream territory. With such an anti-crypto attitude so present throughout the country, this dream appears considerably harder to accomplish. A separate Wells Fargo survey suggests even bleaker results. The study says that only two percent of Americans are invested in bitcoin or some other form of cryptocurrency, while 26 percent say they are intrigued by digital money, but have no plans of investing in it anytime soon. A whopping 70+ percent say that bitcoin is “too risky,” and that they would never invest in it. Hence, the goal of long-term, mainstream acceptance is pushed even further away. The surveys do point out some interesting signs. For example, Americans earning a minimum of $100,000 per year are far more likely to invest in crypto, while young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are more intrigued by cryptocurrencies than older citizens and are likely to invest in digital tokens regardless of their salaries.

        "passage": "It was Day 2 of Facebook’s Congressional Hearing. The pressure was on the social media giant to present a strong case to the House. A strong group that has never been a fan of the social media giant. After a rather grueling day of being questioned by the Senate Banking Committee, David Marcus, Facebook’s Blockchain Chief, headed to the House of Representatives to face questions from the House Committee of Financial Services.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D CA), the Chairperson of the Committee, was the first lawmaker to raise concerns about the Libra and Facebook, and pretty much turn the attention of Capitol Hill to the company’s crypto efforts. Once again, Marcus faced the uphill task of convincing lawmakers that despite its past, Libra would be different.  “Ultimately, if Facebook’s plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments,” she stated. Waters jabbed at Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, where it was reported that malicious Russian state operatives purchased ads on the platform to influence the outcome of the election that produced President Trump. However, if the Senate hearing was considered difficult, Marcus and Facebook were met with a brick wall at the House. Here, the general consensus was pretty much the same; Facebook’s past makes it near impossible for anyone to trust them with their paychecks.  However, while a lot of lawmakers were quick to recommend that the social media giant should close up shop before even launching, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) proposed that Facebook could launch Libra to a million users as a pilot program, doing so with significant regulatory oversight. In part, Maloney said, “I don’t think you should launch Libra at all because the creation of a new currency is a core government function. But at the very least you should agree to do this small pilot program first.” Facebook’s Blockchain Head said that the tech giant had already thought of this approach. He added that a part reason why they announced the whitepaper on time was to allow for regulatory scrutiny. After the event, there was a big reveal. Facebook had reportedly kept the Swiss regulators in the dark. This is ironic, because just yesterday, Marcus had informed the Senate that Libra would be overseen by the Swiss data protection agency. In part, he had stated, “For the purposes of data and privacy protections, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be the Libra Association’s privacy regulator.” However, as reported by news outlet CNBC, Hugo Wyler, Head of Communication at the FDPIC, responded that there hasn’t been any communication between Facebook and the agency. He said, “We have taken note of the statements made by David Marcus, Chief of Calibra, on our potential role as data protection supervisory authority in the Libra context. Until today we have not been contacted by the promoters of Libra.” The agency official added that such communication is still anticipated, as there won’t be any compliance if they don’t understand the project. So far, this hearing has shown that Facebook has a long way to go if it plans on getting approval from Congress. It’s still early days but it looks more unlikely that the regulators would greenlight Libra.",

        "passage": "The Zambian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned the general public to desist from investing in an initial coin offering (ICO) promoted by a suspicious company. According to a report by The Lusaka Times, the company was not registered with the country’s regulatory body and was therefore not authorized to give investment advice.  Cases of fraudulent ICO projects are not uncommon, and various regulators and government agencies have taken time to warn investors against investing in investment schemes that especially promise exorbitant returns on investment. In a statement by the Chief Executive Officer of the Zambia SEC, Philip Chitalu, a company known as Kwakoo, was soliciting investment funds from Zambians for its ICO, Onyxcoin. Chitalu also added that the company’s activities, which include promotion and soliciting of funds for a product like Onyxcoin, fell under the purview of the Securities Act law. The country’s Securities Act, No. 41 of 2016, states that any person or persons offering investment advice for assets viewed as securities, or engaging in trading of such assets in Zambia, must seek approval from the SEC, except in cases where the law exempts such person/company. With the above definition, Kwakoo and its promoters’ actions were in contravention of Zambia’s securities law. Apart from failing to register with the SEC, Kwakoo lured investors with hyperbolic predictions for its Onyxcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency’s value would skyrocket to 1000% by June 2021. However, the Zambia CEO warned investors to be wary about the company and its representatives, stating that Kwakoo isn’t licensed or registered with the regulatory body to offer investment advice or seek funds from Zambians to invest in any financial product within or without the country. Furthermore, Chitalu alerted the public to the risks that came with ICOs, stating that the fundraising venture was not standard in Zambia. Also, the SEC would grant regulatory status depending on the ICO. Currently, there is no robust regulatory landscape in Zambia. The SEC released a notice concerning bitcoin, other virtual currencies, and ICOs. The notice recognized the growth of the cryptocurrency market, and how people are becoming more receptive towards bitcoin, altcoins, and ICOs. However, the SEC warned citizens that bitcoin and other virtual currency were unregulated in the country. Furthermore, the SEC states: Also, in terms of determining if any crypto asset is can be classified as “securities”, the SEC noted that ICOs likely had characteristics of financial securities. In October 2018, the Bank of Zambia, the country’s apex bank, stated that bitcoin and other digital currencies were not a legal tender in the country. Furthermore, investors trading in cryptocurrencies were doing so at their own risk. The country’s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEG) arrested three fraudsters who were involved in money laundering worth over $2 million. Per the report, the scammers lied to the investors that they would help them invest their funds in cryptocurrency. Apart for the Zambia SEC warning against falling into the trap of fraudulent ICO and crypto schemes, its U.S counterpart has issued similar warnings. According to a Blockonomi report back in April 2019, two American financial regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) advised investors to beware of fake bitcoin investment websites. The investors noted that these websites offered unsuspecting investors high returns on little investments and proceeded to give a list of warning signs to protect investors against fraudulent bitcoin investment schemes. Famous celebrities, heavyweight boxer Floyd Mayweather, and DJ and songwriter, DJ Khaled, who promoted the Centra ICO, were fined by the US SEC.",

        "passage": "It has become abundantly apparent that the Bitcoin price crash-induced crypto winter hasn’t managed to seduce bears. The crash in the broader cryptocurrency market, which sent investors running en-masse, has resulted in a number of layoffs at this (not so) budding sector’s most preeminent firms. Bitmain, Huobi, and even ShapeShift are among the notable startups that have purged employees to bolster their bottom line. But the bloodshed is far from over. An Israeli blockchain company is the most recent domino to have fallen in the Rube Goldberg machine-esque cryptocurrency space.  Per a report from local outlet Globes, First Digital Assets Group (FDA), a blockchain application group, will be dropping most employees from its payroll. Citing sources familiar with FDA’s operations, Globes wrote that the company will be “rethinking its policy,” leading to a company-wide overhaul. As a part of this refresh, FDA will purportedly be totally purging its industry research division, One Alpha. The Israeli upstart will also be putting its K1, Stamina, Titan, and Knox ventures on the backburner, merging a majority of these subsidiaries’ facets with the parent group. The insiders didn’t divulge the specifics, nor did First Digital Assets spokespeople, who corroborated the sources’ material. However, it is known that the conglomerate, launched in 2017 as the crypto market rallied dramatically, once had 65 employees in its Givatayim offices. FDA’s representatives told Globes that as Bitcoin underwent an “earthquake,” the C-suite at the company decided to focus on its “liquidity activity (cash flow),” while it aims to redirect its efforts at bolstering offerings built on blockchain platforms, “the technology of the future.” Funnily enough, the company added that it still has a “large sum” in its war chest, which has received $21 million from a handful of venture investors over the company’s two-year history. FDA’s decision to undergo a drastic restructuring comes after mining giant Bitmain shuttered its division in Israel. As reported by Blockonomi previously, the Beijing-headquartered company closed its blockchain development center, whose primary objective was to manage mining pool Connect BTC. The branch was also working on Bitmain’s foray into artificial intelligence, Sophon. Just weeks later, the company closed its Amsterdam offices and Bitcoin mining farm in Rockdale, Texas. Layoffs are harrowing, especially in a space as nascent as blockchain technologies, but one analyst claims that such shortcomings are necessary. How about that? Anti-establishment figure Travis Kling took to Twitter in late-January, remarking that the crypto ecosystem will take another bone-breaking, heart-stopping, and blood-inducing blow before a rally. In a foreboding tweet, Kling, the incumbent chief investment officer at Ikigai, noted that if Bitcoin is to see a resurgence, the recent array of industry shortcomings, including layoffs, exchange collapses, stringent regulation, and cries that “crypto is dead,” will be just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This comment is, of course, in reference to the popular sentiment that true capitulation marks a long-term bottom in any market cycle. The former portfolio manager at Steven Cohen’s personal hedge fund, Point72, isn’t the only industry insider to claim that depressed market conditions are needed. Bully Esq, a prominent analyst, noted that the “bursting” of the Dotcom Bubble was a “necessary correction,” as the downturn spawned Amazon, Google, and a number of other Internet mainstays. Drawing lines between the nascent Dotcom space and cryptocurrencies, Bully added that while a correction is hammering this space, now’s an optimal time for industry participants to accumulate, build, learn, network, and be ready for when this market begins to gain mainstream traction for the second time.",

        "passage": "The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York has indicted the head of a bitcoin escrow company for defrauding investors of $7 million. According to the press release published by the division of the Department of Justice, head of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC, Jon Barry Thompson, was charged with two counts each of commodity and wire fraud on Thursday. Thompson was accused of airbrushing investment risks and false representations of digital assets custody and control, per the release.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated that Thompson lured investors by painting cryptocurrency as a zero-to-low risk investment. Thompson allegedly duped two unnamed companies of $3 million and $4 million in June and July 2018. He promised to invest the funds in Bitcoin and sent false profit records to the victim companies. Neither of the companies received any bitcoin, and Thompson did not return the invested funds. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies,” said Geoffrey. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney added that Thompson capitalized on the ignorance of both companies on cryptocurrency.  “Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest in Bitcoin. Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn’t understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency.” The two commodities fraud charges that were slammed against Thompson each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and each count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Thus, Thompson now faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Cases of crypto-crime like Thompson’s fraud has been rampant of late. With the nascent growth of the cryptocurrency sector, more individuals are willing to go to desperate lengths to get their hands on some coins. In March, 46-year-old New Yorker, Patrick McDonnell was indicted for swindling about 10 victims of at least $194,000 in cryptocurrency. His method was similar to Thompson’s– under the flag of a website called CabbageTech, McDonnell promised investors that he would provide trading advice and purchase and trade cryptocurrency on their behalf. He claimed to help his customers buy bitcoin when he was actually using the pooled funds for personal purposes. On July 25, 46-year old William Green of Wall Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey was also charged by a grand jury for operating an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange. Using a website dubbed Destination Bitcoin, Green converted fiat to cryptocurrency for his customers for a small fee. Although his crime is different from Thompson’s, his transmitting activities were not registered according to the prescribed rules guiding cryptocurrency exchanges. Crypto scams are increasingly littering the face of the crypto sector globally, and are a major drawback for the growth of the sphere. The worrying rate is only making more regulators edgy towards digital assets, and this is causing restrictive crackdowns that are only making it harder for adoption and legalization of the coin. In a recent finding on Bitcoin.com, $1.36 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen by fraudsters during the first two months of 2018. Of this amount, cryptocurrency fraud accounted for 30 percent. It was followed by hacking attempts (22 percent), theft and exit scams (17 percent each), and phishing (13 percent).",

        "passage": "Yesterday, a computer and television were stolen by a team of three suspects in Saratoga, California. The three were allegedly acting as movers and helping a family to load their items into and off of a moving truck. According to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office, the three movers met the family through “a mutual acquaintance”. Things didn’t turn out so well, however, as the suspects demanded money, and paid themselves by taking a computer loaded with bitcoin. A type of scam that has been unfortunately growing is what’s known in some circles as a movers ransom. Basically speaking, a bogus moving company or independent movers will get all of a clients items loaded onto a truck. At this point, they may drive a short distance or even all the way to the destination. Then, the swindle begins. The scammers will typically start to demand additional compensation. If the compensation is not given, scammers will threaten to take things, break objects, or simply drive the truck away with everything inside. Since the victim is in a very weak position as all of their belongings are locked away in a truck, many of them will comply and pay extra money. In the Saratoga case, the Sheriff’s office said: Unbeknownst to the thieving group, the stolen computer apparently was loaded with a bitcoin wallet that held around $10,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. What’s interesting about this is that cases like this could end up setting an important precedent for the future. In most countries, if someone is caught stealing property, the degree of punishment given is often related to the value of goods stolen. For example, stealing a bicycle is often considered a lesser crime than stealing a Ferrari.  The Suspects, Image from Apacnewswire In the US, a minor theft is known as petty larceny. A major theft, on the other hand, is known as grand larceny, and comes with serious jail time and a permanent felony record that will follow the perpetrator for life. The law is also not explicitly clear on a dollar amount that would equal petty versus grand larceny. But what happens if someone steals an old laptop worth say one hundred dollars, but that laptop contained one million dollars in cryptocurrency? Would the thief who stole the laptop, not knowing what was on it, be subject to punishment equivalent to stealing $1 million worth of property? To make things even more complicated, what if the thief stole a device that had keys to an altcoin stash that was nearly worthless, but then later pumped up in value massively after the perpetrator was already arrested? And what point would the value apply to the punishment, if at all? This goes without saying, but anyone who stores cryptocurrency needs to have a way to recover access to it in the event of a stolen device. In the case of the Saratoga theft, if the owner of the computer kept a backup of their private keys, then in the worst case they would only be out the computer and not the bitcoin. We’ve done reviews in the past on some interesting products that can help secure a 12 or 24-words seed phrase such as the Billfodl. An item like that could have prevented any major crypto loss due to physical theft of a device.  Sheriff Laurie Smith also noted that “The public should take the necessary steps to safeguard their virtual property because it is vulnerable like physical property”. With that sage advice in mind, we recommend again not only to protect the devices that you use your wallet on, but also the private keys and seed phrases that access your funds so that you can always recover them to a new device.",

        "passage": "The blockchain development space is attracting some big names. Gary Cohn has Goldman Sachs on his resume, and more recently he worked at the White House, as an economic aide for the Trump administration. Now he is joining the board of advisers at Spring Labs, a Los Angles-based blockchain company. Mr. Cohn has been lying low since March of this year, when he decided to cut his relationship with Trump’s White House off. He had been opposed to President Trumps opening salvo in the ongoing global trade war, which looks good for him in retrospect. Spring Labs is working on blockchain-based solutions for consumer credit, which could be a massive market.  Spring Labs already has a number of prominent advisers, including Nigel Morris, who is the co-founder Capital One bank, and Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). Consumer credit is a staple of the US economy, and if Spring Labs is able to add value to the industry, it could be a great move for Gary Cohn. Gary Cohn seems to be amped about his new position, and the blockchain space. He said that, “I have been very interested in blockchain technology for a number of years, and Spring Labs is developing a network that could have profound implications for the financial services sector, among others,” and, “I am excited to actively support the Spring Labs team in the development of this important business and network,” via a press release. Spring Labs secured almost $15 million USD in financing earlier in 2018. The company sees blockchain’s ability to offer an extra level of data security as a huge benefit to the consumer credit market, which has been subject to numerous hacking attempts. Equifax is a similar company, minus the blockchain angle. They lost the data of nearly 150 million people last year, in a major hack that has been the source of controversy. Consumer credit information is incredibly valuable to hackers, and companies like Equifax are clearly unable to defend sensitive data from bad actors. Blockchain would give banks and credit providers a direct link with consumer credit information, and remove companies like Equifax from the equation. Despite the fact that people like Gary Cohn, Nigel Morris and Sheila Bair, among many others, see value in blockchain, there is still a vocal opposition to the technology. Nouriel Roubini was on the warpath again last week, this time during an informal hearing that was organized by US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The opinions that Mr. Roubini expressed haven’t changed much, and he still feels very negative on anything having to do with blockchain or cryptocurrency. He told the hearing that Bitcoin is, “the mother of all scams” and that blockchain is, “the most hyped technology ever.” There is no doubt a substantial amount of hype surrounding blockchain, which is totally normal for an innovative technology that could make major changes happen at many levels. Whenever a new technology comes along that shows great potential, no matter if it is a railroad, an automobile, or the internet, some amount of speculative fervor seems to grip the markets. Bubbles tend to occur, and many people back platforms and companies that simply won’t make it. Evidence of a speculative frenzy is actually proof of blockchain’s potential, and numerous people understand that it could be a new way to store data, regardless of the kind of blockchain architecture in question. Some of the biggest companies in the world are using blockchain, which is another indication of its future in global business. IBM and Walmart will be implementing a blockchain-based food tracking system over the next year, and many banks are patenting settlement systems that use blockchain. Major Asian banks are working with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to switch over the a blockchain powered trade finance platform, which was designed by Ping-An, and is in use currently in China.",

        "passage": "Last week, prior to the release of Facebook’s Libra, prominent Bitcoin evangelist and educator Andreas Antonopoulos made a surprising comment. In a Q&A Youtube video, he quipped that the corporate cryptocurrency isn’t a threat to Bitcoin, but is instead a threat to Wall Street and traditional finance. The educator attributed his comment to the fact that Libra will presumably cut fees to a minimum, dramatically reduce transaction times, and reach farther than banks can go.  On June 23rd, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) gave a nod to Libra via an extensive report. And just as Antonopoulos predicted, the so-called “Bank For Banks” warned that Silicon Valley in finance could threaten the broader banking industry. For most of their lives, technology companies have stayed away from foraying into financial services. But, as Silicon Valley has looked to bolster its bottom line, firms have begun to take technology and combine it with finance. Google has launched Google Pay; Apple has the Apple Card. And, as you are likely aware of, Facebook and its countless corporate partners (Uber, Spotify, PayPal, Visa, Booking Holdings, etc.) are preparing to launch a cryptocurrency based on a basket of assets deemed “stable”. For the most part, these ventures are innocuous. They are ways to make business more efficient through reducing friction between a consumer and the end merchant. The BIS writes: But, as the entity, a conglomerate of 60-odd central banks, points out, technology companies dipping their toes on finance may also pose a direct threat to “financial stability” and “data protection”. The BIS explains that once Big Tech’s enticing financial services trap consumers, entry barriers can be raised and competition can be stamped out, creating a monopolistic system that may actually hurt mom & pop investors at the end of the day. This act would harm Wall Street institutions, potentially making such banks and funds useless in a world where technology executives have the keys to the financial system. What’s equally as harrowing to the BIS is the potential for Big Tech to harness consumer data to further establish hegemony over everything. The Bank For Bank writes: Indeed, fintech programs have been proven to allow companies to leverage even more data than ever before. A perfect case in point is Robinhood, the no-commission startup brokerage that caters to a millennial audience. The company makes a large portion of its profit by taking the data from user trades, forking it off to high-frequency trading desks, and receiving some commission. Although Facebook’s blockchain division has pledged that Libra will eventually go fully decentralized, many fear that a similar practice may come into use in this new cryptocurrency’s ecosystem.

        "passage": "The stablecoin revolution continues to grow stronger, and Binance has made another move to strengthen its position in the market. The Malta-based exchange Binance, which is the second largest cryptocurrency exchange platform by trade volume, according to CoinMarketCap, recently announced that it would be providing USD Coin (USDC), the USD-pegged stablecoin from crypto firm Circle, according to a blog post published on November 15, 2018. The exchange also noted that they would be offering deposits immediately.  USDC, which was announced back in May 2018 by Circle and was subsequently released in September, is one of the fast-rising stablecoins in the industry that has seen its stock go through the roof since Tether lost its peg last month. Binance joins a host of other major digital asset platforms to have listed USDC, with Coinbase making a similar move at the end of last month. In its statement today, Binance added, “For increased transparency, USDC has engaged a top-ranking auditing firm to release monthly balance attestations of the corresponding USDC and USD balances held/issued.” The exchange also noted that it would provide options for USDC/BNB and USDC/BTC from November 17, 2018. Fiat-backed stablecoins have been receiving an increasing amount of support from exchanges all over the world, particularly with the uncertainty with Tether and the constant volatility of Bitcoin. Last month, digital asset platforms Huobi and OKEx opted to list four of these USD-backed stablecoins at once. The exchanges listed TrueUSD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). Binance, which added support for PAX in September, has been a big admirer of stablecoins for a while. After adding the Paxos Standard Token, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that he hoped more of these stablecoins would surface.  Read: What are Stablecoins? At the time, Zhao had given a vote of confidence on stablecoins, tweeting: Two months after, Binance added support for coins such as Ravencoin (RNV) and Decred (DCR), to name a few. In the few months since Circle launched USDC, the stablecoin has continued to wax stronger, bolstered by the increasing amount of support and adoption that it has gotten all over the crypto landscape. It is currently available on exchanges that represent tens of billions of dollars in trading volume. USDC has a current supply of over $148 million, with dozens of digital asset platforms currently supporting it. Binance’s move to add support for USDC won’t surprise many in the market, as the digital asset platform is committed to making positive business moves that will shore up its revenue streams while providing trading options for its customers. Speaking with CNBC in an interview, Zhao said that the company was not concerned by the reduction in trading volume that was caused by the slump, adding that this slump signaled nothing more than a “stability period.” He also said that the company is still signing new users up at an accelerated rate, even though the current level doesn’t math up to what it was in January. Zhao argued that the decrease in the trading volume is a precursor to stabilization in prices, and when people trade less, they most likely end up shifting their cons to their wallets. However, with Binance, the opposite seems to be the case. “When we see an increase in BTC holdings over time, it usually means that people are not moving their BTC to us,” Zhao explained. Binance CEO went on to add that he expects to see an entrance of institutions into the industry as they will ostensibly provide a wide range of regulated- and more stable- coins.",

        "passage": "Greed just leads to trouble – several people in the crypto space can attest to this. One man, Homero Joshua Garza, who’s company has been accused of running a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme, has recently been sentenced to 21 months in prison by a federal judge for allegedly giving into greed.  The crypto arena appears marred with those who would manipulate a new and growing form of financial technology for their own benefit. Recently, it’s been discovered that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) are fake and have made off with millions of dollars in investors’ hard-earned cash. New ventures raise money for their operations by selling new coins that users will need to access the companies’ products and services. The trouble is, many of them disappear halfway through. Operations never come to fruition, and while the executives still make off with all that cash, those who invested their funds wind up in a monetary gutter. While this case doesn’t involve an ICO, the notion was clearly the same. Greed became the primary factor behind the business, and the man in charge is paying the price. Garza pled guilty last year to one count of wire fraud after his company GAW Miners ran an alleged Ponzi scheme that garnered roughly $9 million from thousands of people across the globe.  Garza, during better times. Image from Bitcoin.com Following his near two-year long prison sentence, Garza will have to undergo three years of supervised release and pay the $9 million back. Prosecutors were particularly blunt in their case against Garza, commenting that he “lied to investors and customers and took their money.” GAW Miners – short for “Geniuses at Work” Miners – first came about in 2014. The business made a name for itself reselling mining rigs and began as a legitimate enterprise. Unfortunately, by the end of the year, bitcoin’s hash rate had increased significantly, which rendered the company’s mining software null and void. Garza was unable to pay back his initial investors and tried to fix things by creating his own altcoin, later dubbed “Pay Coin.” Garza allegedly offered each coin at $20 and made false claims of a $100 million reserve. The currency also touted its own cloud-based mining and wallet services, neither of which existed, and used money from new investors to pay old ones. When Garza’s brother Carlos was issued a subpoena in 2015 to appear before Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyers in Boston, he responded to each question with: In their sentencing memorandum, federal prosecutors write: Garza explained in a phone interview that GAW began because of scammers. When he first heard about bitcoin, Garza was intrigued by the technology and spent $100,000 on a mining rig he never received. Though he refused to say which company he had purchased from, the situation led to much frustration and he decided to start a company to try and fix things. He says that GAW Miners made over $1 million in its first month, and that the company had over 100,000 customers at one time, with roughly 10,000 to 15,000 new accounts being added each day. Garza submitted a three-page apology to the judge overseeing his case and admitted that while the company began with a “legitimate purpose,” it eventually became a tool for greed. The letter explains: Garza has been ordered to report to prison on January 4, 2019.",

        "passage": "If you’ve never considered keeping your crypto funds outside of an exchange, the events in the Republic of Ireland would give you a rethink. It appears Bitsane, a cryptocurrency exchange platform based out of Dublin, has ceased its operations and disappeared with users funds, per a Forbes report.  But there were warning signs. According to the report, users had witnessed multiple issues with withdrawals as far back as May 2019. Some weeks after, Bitsane deletes its social media accounts, shuts down its servers and disappeared. In addition to that, Bitsane’s trading information on CoinMarketCap has also not been updated for the past 10 days. All signs point to the fact that Bitsane just kiboshed and vanished into thin air. Multiple user groups on Facebook and Telegram have seen various complaints lodged, with customers claiming to have lost crypto assets valued anywhere from $5,000 to $150,000.  According to the report, an anonymous user said, “I was trying to transfer XRP out to Bitcoin or cash or anything, and it kept saying ‘temporarily disabled.’ I knew right away there was some kind of problem. I went back in to try to look at those tickets to see if they were still pending, and you could no longer access Bitsane.” Bitsane was established back in 2016, and it has been providing spot trading capabilities for numerous cryptocurrencies ever since. The company gained notoriety as one of the first exchanges to partner with Ripple Labs and offer crypto trading in XRP. It has continued to grow since then, with data on CoinMarketCap showing Bitsane had about 246,000 registered users and a daily trading volume in excess of $7 million. However, even with all its considerable popularity, it would seem that the exchange’s operators have now pulled a Houdini on their customers. While there could be various reasons why the exchange would suddenly disappear, the consensus is that its operators were con artists who simply waited for the perfect time to elope with users’ funds. This looks like QuadrigaCX with a different national flag. Ireland isn’t known to be particularly crypto-averse, and it has witnessed a lot of involvement in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Most notable is the expansion of Coinbase’s Debit Card into the country, along with five other European nations. Earlier this year, three major Irish banks also partnered with auditing giant Deloitte to run a pilot on the Ethereum blockchain-based data management platform. Blockchain courses are also being taught in tertiary institutions. The Dublin City University joined forces with Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet to develop a Blockchain Master’s Degree course in May. So, it’s pretty evident that the country has a solid relationship with the blockchain technology. While a lot of crypto exchanges tend to shut down operations and close shop due to stringent regulations from their home governments, this couldn’t have been the case for Bitsane. Any argument of a government crackdown is thus rendered mute. For now, it’s a bit too early to say what caused Bitsane to vanish. However, there’s a really slim chance that its operators would be found.",

        "passage": "A recent report by the Financial Times has revealed that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have collaborated to launch a private blockchain network, which will enable “explorations and experimentations” into Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In addition to that, both institutions have reportedly created a digital asset, dubbed the “Learning Coin,” based on their joint blockchain network. The report claims that the Learning Coin was created as a tool to aid the institutions in their effort to better understand blockchain technology, including its function as an underlying technology for crypto assets.  However, while the asset does seem like it is a cryptocurrency, the Financial Times stresses that it isn’t exactly one. For one, the currency doesn’t have a monetary value, and it isn’t tied to any known fiat currency. In addition to that, the coin is only intended for use by IMF and World Bank staff as they pursue “a deeper knowledge” of blockchain technology. As such, the coin, as well as all of its properties and uses, will only be accessible within both institutions. Also, an application was also reported to have been developed by the institutions, and it is expected to accompany the Learning Coin’s use. The app would help staffers with research efforts, and it will support learning materials and content such as presentations, informational videos, and blog posts. Staff at both institutions were said to be earning Learning Coin tokens whenever they reach laid-out educational milestones in their blockchain experimentation and exploration efforts. Also, while the coin still doesn’t have any real-world or monetary value, workers at the institutions are said to be working on how employees can redeem their tokens in exchange for certain “rewards.” The news is coming less than a week after Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the IMF, stated that new and emerging technologies such as blockchain technology are having impacts on the stability of the global financial system. Lagarde’s expressed this sentiment while in an interview with news outlet CNBC at the 2019 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF in Washington D.C. on April 10. As part of her comments, the French policymaker had stated: She pointed out that central banks and financial regulators all over the world have recognized the potential of blockchain-based technologies to transform how the global financial system operates. Last year, Lagarde also encouraged the exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). In a speech at the Singapore FinTech Festival on November 14, Lagarde called for an increased issuance of CBDCs, pointing out a decrease in the demand for physical cash and the growing appeal for digital money. The IMF Chief also stated that major crypto assets are “vying for a spot in the cashless world, constantly reinventing themselves in the hope of offering more stable value, and quicker, cheaper settlement.” Also, last summer, the World Bank launched the first global blockchain-based bond settlement, raising $81 million in the process. The bond, which was handled by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank), had additional investors, including Northern Trust, the NSW Treasury Corporation, QBE Insurance, among others. In an official statement, CommBank stated that it was handling the bond with its own private Ethereum blockchain, and the Microsoft Corporation has reviewed its security and architecture. The two-year bond, which was dubbed the Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument (BONDI, in reference to Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach), was viewed as a first step towards moving bond transactions from manual processes to cheaper and faster-automated ones.",

        "passage": "Blockchain reorgs are generally cast as assaults, namely in the manner of a 51 percent attack. Yet after the cryptoeconomy’s most popular exchange Binance was hacked out of a whopping 7,000 bitcoin this week, a reorg of the Bitcoin blockchain was floated as a way to potentially remedy the attack. The suggestion quickly generated controversy.  The current round of reorg debates started after Jeremy Rubin, a cryptocurrency specialist and past contributor to Bitcoin Core, suggested in the early aftermath of the hack that Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao could explore reaching out to bitcoin miners to “coordinate a reorg to undo the theft,” i.e. to reorg the stolen BTC out of the attackers’ control.  Shortly after Rubin’s tweets, the suggestion was passed along to Zhao, who then mentioned the possibility of a “rollback” on a livestream update with the Binance community. However, it didn’t take long for Zhao to leave the notion behind upon reaching out to knowledgeable stakeholders in the ecosystem. The Binance CEO cited the possibility of damaging the “credibility” of bitcoin as well as the impracticality of corralling the necessary support as reasons for not pushing for a reorg.  Yet even after Zhao seemed to put the matter to rest, debates about reorgs started picking up steam in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. One day after the hack, the reorg topic reached enough of a fever pitch that Zhao issued another comment on the episode, arguing that Rubin’s suggestion was briefly considered — nothing more — in the wake of an emergency.  Others were surprised the possibility of a reorg was publicly considered at all. Michael Novogratz, co-founder of the crypto bank Galaxy Digital, called such talk “close to heresy.” Responding to Novogratz’s comment, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin argued that a remedial rollback of everyone’s transactions would be “possibly fatal” for a project.  For his part, Andreas Antonopoulos, author and co-author of Mastering Bitcoin and Mastering Ethereum respectively, likened a remedial reorg as akin to a “bail-out for a bank,” adding that “there won’t be a bailout here.”  Others, like Larry Cermak of The Block, suggested a reorg was pointless because Binance would be able to generate revenue to make up for the lost funds within a matter of weeks. Moreover, the exchange already sets aside 10 percent of its trading fees for a fund to cover black swan events like hacks.  As reorg chatter increased, many analysts and pundits in the space said Binance should not pursue the controversial strategy. However, others highlighted that the strategy was totally permissible on a technical level and was thus one that could always be pursued, for better or for worse and whether anyone liked it or not.  On a related note, Bitcoin Udi Wertheimer highlighted in an associated thread that “There’s no absolute finality in bitcoin,” only practical finality. That is to say, there may be a block depth in the Bitcoin ledger that is too deep for any party to feasibly reach during a reorg, but it’s not a set number that can be readily known.  With that said, the aforementioned Jeremy Rubin later added he still thought a reorg “within 6 blocks” could be a “standard way of dealing with a hack” like the kind Binance was hit with this week.  Whether you think a remedial reorg is a good idea or bad idea, it’s clear such a move would be very expensive. In the early wake of the Binance hack, Bitcoin developer and entrepreneur Jimmy Song calculated that it would’ve already taken hundreds of BTC by that point to effectively pay for a reorg of the Bitcoin network.

        "passage": "On Monday afternoon, video footage of police officers at an office festooned with Tron (TRX) logos was found on Twitter. In an impassioned tweet, a user speculated that the officers, which sported uniforms of the Beijing fuzz, were raiding the office. China is, of course, a country that has recently done its best to curb the adoption of Bitcoin and assets it can’t control.  As the footage was shared, a large sum of TRX tokens was transferred to Huobi, leading many to believe that the raid thesis was accurate. But, the Chinese cryptocurrency startup, the brainchild of Justin Sun, recently came out to clear the air, providing its community with an explanation for this whole debacle. On Monday, Blockonomi drew attention to a resurgence in crypto-related Ponzi schemes. The most notable of those that were mentioned was named “Wave Field Super Community”, which touted itself as a Super Representative of the Tron blockchain. According to individuals that read and could translate the firm’s marketing material, lofty returns were promised. Of course, everything was too good to be true. Prior to its shutdown, the scheme managed to secure over $30 million worth of Chinese yuan from thousands of gullible investors within six months’ time. Wave Field Super Community’s tactics were so damaging that local media reports that a single mother killed herself over the lost funds, which she borrowed from a neighbor and was unable to pay back. This death, coupled with the loss of many families’ savings, has led to an uproar in China. And this uproar, according to a Medium blog post from Tron, led to a number of angry victims taking to all forums possible to make their voices heard. One such forum was an office in Beijing that is affiliated with Tron, which is headquartered in San Francisco. On Monday, a number of enraged individuals tried to storm the office, crying that Tron is a scam because of its faux tacit affiliation with the scam. As such, the office, which is owned be Beijing research and development firm Raybo, called law enforcement to ensure that its employees were safe. In an announcement on the matter, Tron tried to further itself from the scam, claiming that it denounced the company earlier this year on its Chinese social media pages, along with other channels in English. It is clear that these denunciations were ineffective, as made evident by the pseudo-protest at Raybo and the purported suicide.  It is unclear what occurred after police arriving at the office, but the arrival presumably resulted in the victims being escorted off the premises. This unfortunate tidbit of news comes as China’s crypto scene has seen a monumental resurgence, a resurgence that has not been replicated in the West and in other parts of the world. Firstly, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have entered back into the Chinese mainstream conscious. Data from WeChat (top app in China), Baidu (China’s Google), and other digital services, show exponential upticks in search interest and mentions of cryptocurrency and related terms. And arguably more importantly, the government is looking at the industry again. In fact, a recent report from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post confirms that the People’s Bank of China is actively discussing the creation of a digital Yuan. Whether or not such a project will be based on a blockchain remains to be seen. But, this marks a massive turning point in the future of this industry, as one of the world’s largest financial institutions announcing intentions to host its own cryptocurrency does, in the eyes of some, validate the technology.",

According to a Reuters report on the matter, scammers ran a bogus ad, that has now been removed, that reportedly tried to convince users to buy Bitcoin from a company endorsed by De Mol.  The billionaire creator of the “Big Brother” reality television program is suing Facebook for not preventing the ads from running on its platform and for dragging its feet on removing the fraudulent ads when complaints were sent in. Del Mol’s lawyers are asking the Amsterdam District Court to call Facebook to order. According to them, Dutch consumers had lost around 1.7 million Euros ($1.9 million) to celebrity-backed scams. They want the court to order the social media giant to create a filter that automatically blocks ads that mentions De Mol’s name along with cryptocurrency, which they argue had caused the media magnate reputational damage. This is not the first time a celeb has faulted Facebook for not doing enough to prevent bogus ads for running on its platform. TODAY SHOW’s Co-Host Georgie Gardner slammed the tech giant in 2018 for not rejecting an ad that used her image to defraud citizens. Facebook’s legal representative Jens van den Brink said that Facebook could not be forced to change its procedures on ads monitoring and processing for an individual. He explained that Facebook has a reporting system that allows customers to report ads that are deemed to be inappropriate and that the company removed the Del Mol’s bogus and once the complaints were filed by members of the community. Judge Remmine Dudok van Heel who presided over the hearing questioned Van den Brink on Facebook’s vetting process and on whether the tech company checked the webpages the ads link to. Facebook’s director of product management Rob Leathern told reporters that the tech company takes the issue of fraudulent ads seriously and was proactively working to stopping them from reoccurring in the future. He was quoted in the Reuters report saying: Celebrity-backed scams have increased all across Europe. In the UK, Action Fraud reported that victims had lost £27m to these scams from 2018 till date. Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to consumers to watch out for crypto schemes that were being promoted using celebrity images and in some rare occasions prestigious addresses to lure investors. In Australia, celebrity-backed scams are on a winning streak. As Blockonomi reported, Australians have been targeted at every angle, losing over $14 million to scams in 2019 and over $2 million on crypto scams on Facebook. The most recent incident involved Australian TV presenters Karl Stefanovic and Waleed Aly.",

In addition to being home to a thriving community of blockchain start-ups, Singapore’s central bank (The Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS) has declared that blockchain is a “fundamental” technology.  While speaking at Consensus: Singapore Damien Pang, the head of technology infrastructure MAS, said that, There are few other places in the world that have created such an open legal framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency. Singapore has also been a big beneficiary of China’s love/hate relationship with cryptos. China has recently made an about-face in terms of blockchain policy, but Beijing is still very negative on cryptocurrency in general.  Read: PBoC-Backed Ping An Blockchain Trade Finance Platform Goes Live 57 blockchain-focused projects in Singapore raised more than $570 million USD via ICOs in the second quarter of this year, which compares with just 14 projects based in Hong Kong that brought in $47.6 million USD. Singapore breaks digital assets into three groups: payment tokens, utility tokens, and securities. While onstage at Consensus: Singapore, Damien Pang made it a point to mention that the MAS has no plans to regulate utility tokens, but they will introduce a payment service law for payment tokens by the end of 2018. The MAS has already teamed up with Singapore’s stock exchange and three other partners to create a digital token settlement system that will be blockchain-based. Called “Project Ubin”, the program will likely help Singapore cement its position as a global crypto hub. The talent pool for blockchain development is pretty tight at the moment. With limited human resources, Singapore is potentially creating a blockchain development culture that will be difficult to challenge. Once talented people have access to a well-regulated economy, and easy development capital, it isn’t likely they will stray too far from their home. Unlike China or the USA, Singapore is moving quickly to establish a reliable legal framework for digital assets, which will help companies to invest confidently in the nation-state. China’s crackdown on one of the world’s most promising new technologies has driven companies like imToken, Bitmain and Huobi to open regional headquarters there. Singapore offers major advantages for companies that need access to both new technology and established banking infrastructure. As a global banking hub, they can give blockchain start-ups an upper hand in a sector that is probably going to revolutionize the financial industry. Leading blockchain PR firm Wachsman just announced they would be opening up their first Asian office, in Singapore of all places. They are planning on expanding their current staff, and will probably help some of Singapore’s blockchain start-ups to spend some of the money they have been pulling in. The firm’s founder and CEO, David Wachsman, said this via a press release about their new venture, Wachsman has plans to beef-up its staff globally over the next few years as well. Their business could be viewed as a barometer of how much the blockchain industry has expanded over the last few years. David Wachsman began the firm back in 2015, and was the only employee. Now they have offices in Dublin, New York, and soon, Singapore.",

        "passage": "An Indian tech firm is currently developing a blockchain settlements layer for banks in Thailand. The infrastructure will enable the participating banks to form an interbank network that will allow payment settlements using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Thailand is the latest in a growing list of countries actively developing financial protocols built on decentralized ledger technology (DLT). The news is yet another positive development for the Southeast Asian country in its quest to adopt cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  According to Business Insider, Indian tech firm, Wipro is building a blockchain settlements protocol for eight banks in Thailand. This settlements layer will allow the use of cryptocurrency in interbank transactions. The blockchain infrastructure is part of Project Inthanon – Thailand’s CBDC pilot. Announcing the development in a statement published on Tuesday (May 7, 2019), Wipro said: For Thailand, the introduction of a CBDC isn’t about creating a new national cryptocurrency but to optimize the efficiency of back-office operations in its banking sector. The overall goal is to reduce the cost of banking by replacing intermediary third-party protocols with trustless systems. Thai banking regulators also hope the adoption of blockchain technology will improve the security of the nation’s banking infrastructure. Banks in Thailand have suffered data breaches affecting hundreds of thousands of customers. If successful, the blockchain settlements layer currently being jointly developed by Wipro and R3 could see DLT being employed in Thailand’s interbank settlement infrastructure. Thailand is one of 40 nations actively trying to utilize blockchain technology across several industries. Recently, reports emerged that Iran’s central bank was in partnership with Areatak, a Tehran-based blockchain startup to create a national DLT infrastructure for the country’s financial sector. Project Borna as it is called in Iran will see commercial banks and fintech startups offering competitive services on a blockchain layer being developed based on IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric. The news of the blockchain-based interbank settlements layer comes at a time when Thailand is increasingly adopting the emerging digital economy. Since laying the legal and legislative groundwork in 2018, the Southeast Asian nation has continued to lead the way in creating an enabling environment for the cryptocurrency landscape. As previously reported by Blockonomi, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced updates to the country’s Securities and Exchange Act of 2019. This amended Act will see the inclusion of security token offerings in the primary market. In mid-March 2019, the Thai Sec gave its approval for the first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) portal. Rather than clamping down on crypto commerce, Thai regulators continue to focus on building a robust legal infrastructure for blockchain businesses. Meanwhile, India despite being open to blockchain technology continues to come down hard on cryptocurrency. Unlike other countries exploring CBDC’s the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shelved its own plans without issuing any details of the study conducted on the matter. There are even reports that the government is looking to completely ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Back in 2018, the RBI prohibited banks from offering services to Bitcoin exchanges leading to the departure of many such companies. The RBI even excluded cryptocurrencies from its recently published fintech regulatory sandbox.",

        "passage": "The wait is over: Bakkt’s bitcoin futures are being launched next month. The cryptoeconomy has been captivated with all things Bakkt ever since Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner-operators of the NYSE and other major financial markets, announced back in August 2018 that it was launching the cryptocurrency exchange and physically-settled bitcoin futures products. In the past year, Bakkt’s repeatedly pushed those plans back in order to get things right and not rush its rollout. But the final stretch is in, company chief executive officer Kelly Loeffler revealed in an August 16th blog post. Therein, Loeffler confirmed the firm has achieved the needed steps to launch its bitcoin futures on September 23rd.  The announcement comes on the same day that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — separately infamous in the cryptoeconomy for creating the BitLicense — granted Bakkt a banking charter to operate the Bakkt Trust Company in the state. That trust company will serve as the qualified custodian for the Bakkt Warehouse, where Bakkt will safely store the bitcoin that underpin its physically-delivered futures products. There will be two such contracts to start, one of which will track the bitcoin price monthly and the other daily. The futures themselves will be traded on the ICE Futures US platform and settled on ICE Clear US. “This offers customers unprecedented regulatory clarity and security alongside a regulated, globally accessible exchange in a market underserved by institutional-grade infrastructure,” Loeffler said on Friday. Recent developments indicated it was only a matter of time until Bakkt launched. The firm started user acceptance testing back in July. And ICE’s leadership noted even more recently that Bakkt was on the verge of being a-go. “Subject to final regulatory approvals, we plan to launch our physically settled bitcoin futures in the very near future,” ICE CEO Jeffrey Sprecher had said during an August 1st earnings call. Back in the spring, reports swirled that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had qualms over how Bakkt was planning to custody bitcoin for its futures products. The Commission allegedly wanted Bakkt to optimize its custody plans further. In the time since then, it appears Bakkt did just that. The CFTC hasn’t pressed the issue and later accepted Bakkt’s self-certification process. But the CFTC certainly won’t hesitate to apply pressure if it feels it needs to. Consider the recent case of LedgerX. The company’s leadership announced it rolled out a physically-delivered bitcoin futures product to U.S. users on July 31st. However, that didn’t end up being the case. Over the span of the next day, the CFTC told LedgerX to censor its tweets associated with that botched launch because the firm “has not yet been approved by the Commission,” CFTC chief communications officer Michael Short later noted to CoinDesk. Things got tenser from there, as LedgerX CEO Paul Chou floated the idea of suing the Commission for “breach of duty,” among other things. The company’s press representative at the time also resigned. If LedgerX had successfully brought its physically-delivered bitcoin futures to market on July 31st, it would’ve beat Bakkt and other companies like ErisX to the punch. We’ve seen bitcoin futures before from CME Group and Cboe, but these have been cash-settled products. Bakkt’s physically-settled bitcoin futures could be a game changer for demand around bitcoin, as BTC will need to be purchased and sent to the owner upon a contract’s completion. As these contracts will be taking place daily and monthly, buy pressure around bitcoin could see a boon on September 23rd and beyond. And with LedgerX and ErisX seemingly not far behind, things are set to get more and more institutional around the OG cryptocurrency in the months ahead.",

        "passage": "During the 2018 bear market, the cryptoeconomy’s naysayers drummed many in the mainstream into thinking the bitcoin price was on a one-way track to becoming worthless. However, in light of the genesis cryptocurrency’s recent marked resurgence, optimism generally is rising as it seems clearer than ever that bitcoin’s best days are yet to come.  That optimism is being driven by several notable milestones being hit. For example, the bitcoin price just reached its best valuation so far in 2019, having crossed $11,000 USD over the weekend. That latest surge helped BTC achieve a 15-month price high, as the coin hadn’t traded over $11,000 since last spring. And that’s not all: the OG cryptocurrency has gained more than 160 percent in Q2 2019, making it the best quarter for “digital gold” since bitcoin jumped up 230 percent in Q4 2017, when the coin founded by Satoshi Nakamoto hit its all-time price high to date of $20,000. With a market capitalization over $195 billion at press time, bitcoin has indeed picked up steam after having entered this year’s second quarter just over the $4,000 mark. Of course, BTC’s best stretch ever remains Q1 2013, when the cryptocurrency spiked up by more than 600 percent. Yet that spike didn’t come after widespread calls of bitcoin’s doom in mainstream media circles. Indeed, the difference between then and today is that the current bitcoin run-up comes after many pundits said the cryptocurrency would never see a five-digit price point again. Now, bitcoin is only down 45 percent from its all-time price high. And the weekend surge means BTC is presently up 83 percent on the year and up 1,580 percent over the last five years. The upward movement comes as another blow to those who have likened bitcoin’s popularity to the popularity of tulips during Tulip Mania, a speculative bubble that reached a fever pitch before abruptly bursting in the 17th century Dutch Republic. Tulip prices never recovered during that “mania,” but the bitcoin price has recovered after 2018 and several times before that. Interest is flowing around Bitcoin once more, with Google searches for the cryptocurrency acutely on the rise. That’s no surprise, as social media powerhouse Facebook announced their Libra crypto last week, which brought considerable attention in kind to BTC, the cryptoeconomy’s reigning asset. The grand question for now, then: can the renewal of attention help power the bitcoin price to new heights? For his part, Trace Mayer, a long-time Bitcoiner, analyst, and maestro of the Bitcoin Knowledge podcast, thinks it’s possible that the bitcoin price eclipses its previous all-time high before the curtains close on 2019. Mayer noted as much during a June 24th tweet, in which he noted his “Mayer Multiple” model had the bitcoin price hitting $15,000 around September 2019 before reaching as high as $21,000 by year’s end. Mayer’s latest analysis also indicated BTC could cross over $30,000 next summer.  Of course, the future is ultimately inscrutable, so there’s no certainty that comes along with such predictions. Rather, Mayer — and other analysts like him — have used the available data to make their best bets. Yet with bitcoin putting up an impressive quarter and hitting its best valuation so far in 2019, the coin definitely has momentum going for it right now, and that momentum appears pointed upwards for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Mayer and similarly optimistic traders would be far from totally surprised to see BTC crack through $20,000 this year — especially not with Bitcoin’s fresh halvening set to take place next spring. That halvening will cut Bitcoin’s block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, and as such, the routine event is widely considered to  reinforce supply scarcity. Moreover, halvenings are also considered by some analysts to lead to acutely bullish price conditions.",

        "passage": "Xu Ke is could probably be defined as a prodigy. She is a native of Beijing, and the founder of China’s first blockchain-based social media site, called “Ono”. At 24 years old, that is likely enough to fit into the “prodigy” category. Xu Ke has a lot more to offer, and her Beijing-based Nome Lab is also the creator of the popular blockchain game, “CryptoDogs”, as well as Ono. The money to found Nome Lab came from poker tables that Xu Ke played on when she was in the USA, studying as a foreign exchange student in California. She was able to use her winnings to amass bitcoins, and she sold 20,000 of them them in 2014 for around $214 USD per bitcoin. With the 2 million USD+ that the bitcoin sale netted her, Nome Lab was born.  All told, Xu Ke has had a pretty amazing run so far. Now she is at the center of Ono, and a very new direction for social media in China. Ono is a dApp, and is all but immune to censorship. This puts it at odds with the centralized control structure that exists in China, though it doesn’t seem to be affecting the growth and popularity of the platform.  Xu Ke, Image from HackerNoon According to Xu Ke, Ono is designed to compete with Facebook. While this might seem far-fetched at first glance, a dApp-based social media platform has some unique advantages that could give it a competitive edge. Xu Ke is well aware of how the social media majors have betrayed the trust of their users, and she puts Ono on an entirely different level.  Screenshots of the Ono App In a recent interview with Forbes, she had this to say about Ono’s foundational philosophy, One of the biggest problems that people have is understanding that the social media majors, like Facebook, aren’t acting in their user’s best interests. The Facebook facade looks friendly, and shows users what their connections are posting, but hidden under the surface there is a lot more going on. Centralized social media platforms like Facebook fall into an ethical gray area. They are controlled by government regulations. They also have hand-in-glove relationships with the highest levels of Western state security agencies, like the NSA and CIA. The most recent Facebook scandal that involved Cambridge Analytica and election manipulation put their view of user privacy on display, but it is one of many that show the risks involved in trusting social media to a private company. Unfortunately for Facebook users, it is one in a string of events that puts the long-term viability of a corporate-government (This structure fits the definition of “Fascist” à la Franco or Mussolini) controlled social media mega-platform into question. In some ways the 2012 Facebook study that openly manipulated user’s feeds in an attempt to change their emotional state should be far more disturbing than what happened with Cambridge Analytica. The Facebook/NSA PRISM program is also a testament to how users put their data at risk, and how little accountability actually exists in the emerging centralized social media landscape. Whether or not user data on Xu Ke’s Ono could be used in a similar way by state authorities is an open question. What is more certain is that if state actors used a blockchain-based social media platform like Ono for their own purposes, there would be an ironclad record of their meddling. A pile of bitcoins wasn’t the only thing that Xu Ke seems to have brought back from her exchange in California. She had this to say on how her platform is organized, “Ono is run democratically, and lets content creators retain ownership over their content and get rewarded,” Xu Ke pointed out in a tweet. It is difficult not to be blinded by the irony in the social media sphere. Facebook, which was born and raised in the USA, would have been an ideal tool for the East German Secret Police, back when they existed. Now, a Beijing-born poker-playing prodigy has started up a social media outlet in China, which puts democracy, ownership, and accountability into a leading role.",

        "passage": "Said to be the fastest public blockchain-based platform on the globe, Waves is announcing the second round of the private funding for the project dubbed Vostok, which is a blockchain platform and system integrator for government and enterprise blockchain solutions. It was announced in a press release provided by Vostok on Mar. 14th, that Waves platform will be organizing another round of private funding for their blockchain enterprise solution with investors from Southeast Asia, China, and Europe already participating in funding the project.  The project was introduced back in 2018 with the first funding round that brought $ 120 million to the prominent blockchain enterprise solution in addition to having its patron, Waves, predicting another round of $ 120 million, which would also raise the presently estimated market capitalization to $ 1.2 billion. Introducing the community to Vostok back on Apr. 12th, Waves presented their most recent project as a part of Waves ecosystem, created to allow implementation of Waves technology across enterprise and government IT systems, initially describing Vostok as an attempt to build and develop a blockchain-based layer for decentralized Web, popularly called Web 3.0. During the same year, on Oct. 23rd, Waves representatives shared the news on Medium on the matter of setting a new record for the maximum number of daily transactions on the ledger, that way beating XRP, EOS and ETH with over 6.1 million transactions processed in the course of 24 hours, which provided Waves with benevolent status among similar blockchain projects. While Waves is working on technology that could facilitate the development of decentralized Web, Vostok plays an important role in this case scenario as the project should help Waves build the foundation for the “digital future” of next generation. The project was tested by numerous global organizations, including the famous Sberbank, since it was first announced in April 2018, while Dolfin, an investment group based in London, is set to coordinate the second funding round deal. The first funding round that was held in December 2018 for private investors secured the project’s second round only several months later, set to sell 10% of the future issue of VST, as the project previously received valuation of 600 million dollars after the second round where 20% of the future issue of VST units were distributed to institutional and private investors. The distribution was set in accordance with potential benefits that institutional and private investors are set to bring to the project development. The second funding round should end on May 31st, 2019, while the team behind Waves platform expects to see 100 million VST units sold within the private sale, which should create a capital of 1.2 billion dollars. In the meanwhile, the founder and CEO of Waves platform, Sasha Ivanov, is hoping to see the second round opening “opportunities to enter new markets”, among other things. The CEO explained that Vostok represents a private blockchain that combines technology and solutions previously tested for building the international blockchain platform, Waves, which includes innovations of digital technology such as Big Data, industrial Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. According to the CEO of Dolfin, a London-based investment group, the main objective of the project at the present is to attract institutional investors alongside capital ventures and mutual funds, which would ultimately boost the interest in Vostok. Vostok project is already making a commotion in the market ahead of the second funding round, as according to the initial press release, representatives are already in the midst of negotiations for setting up the first projects backed by Vostok in China, Europe, and Southeast Asia.",

        "passage": "Australian lawmakers are set to outlaw the use of cash in transactions exceeding the value of AUD$10,000, which equates to around $6,900. Some in the crypto space have suggested that this only accentuates the value and need for Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies.  A Treasury draft legislation outlined the proposed limit. Per the document, which can be found at the below link, lawmakers suggested that preventing consumers from using cash in transactions exceeding the aforementioned sum could “send a strong signal to the community that it is not acceptable to avoid tax and other obligations by paying with cash.” It was added that this proposed legislation is a direct recommendation from Australia’s Black Economy Taskforce. Should the legislation be approved, it is set to come into effect by January 1st, 2020 — less than six months away. Per the legislature, those found in violation of this (honestly Orwellian) rule may be subject to up to two years imprisonment and/or a fine of $25,200.  What’s weird is that this isn’t the first case of a large country setting a cash transaction limit in place. Crypto analyst Rand recently noted that more stringent restrictions exist in nations like Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and Greece. But there’s a silver lining here: the Australian government made it clear that they don’t plan to extend this ban in the crypto space. Regulators wrote that by banning certain digital assets could hamper the industry: Still, the bill isn’t all fine and dandy. This could be seen as Australia’s first step towards a cashless society, one where central bank digital currencies and other government-controlled payment mechanisms are the norm. But there’s an issue with this: privacy. You can already see privacy issues in early-stage cashless societies, namely China. In some regions and through certain applications, debtors are put on full blast, lambasted in public for failing to pay back their creditors. And soon, every step one takes, each transaction one makes, and the words one says online will constitute their “social score”. Those found not to be complying with the party line will be punished, severely. Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time Bitcoin educator, has likened this form of indirect censorship to a violation of free speech. The Greek-British author and coder often claims that money is a language, and that making certain transactions illegal or cutting people out of infrastructure is a growing issue in today’s society. As Rob Paone, a cryptocurrency personality and founder of Proof of Talent, recently wrote on Twitter: “going cashless means a financial surveillance state.” What’s wrong with surveillance? Governments with access to everything can theoretically protect citizens from criminals. But, as crypto researcher Hasu and Three Arrows Capital’s Su Zhu wrote in an extensive post on digital cash, “The specters of terrorism and organized crime are often cited [for the need for survillence]. But this makes the naive assumption that governments itself can never become evil.” The duo writes that cashless societies are less, not more, susceptible to tyranny, overreach, and authoritarian policies that can end up forcing society into a corner. Just look to North Korea as a perfect case in point. A surveillance state or surveillance world is exactly where Bitcoin shines. As BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post published to the company blog, the “censored, centralized, and top-down” digital monies of the future pale in comparison to Bitcoin in a number of respects. “Bitcoin runs via a network of voluntary, independent, and self-interested actors, who neither demand nor require any favours or permissions; a few basis points in transaction fees is literally all they want from anyone,” he wrote, drawing clear lines between decentralized and centralized crypto assets. The former banker went on to note that when, not if, cash is abolished, meaning the death of traditional financial privacy, Bitcoin should see adoption due to the “moral and even psychological” need for the ability to keep information to oneself.",

As you can see from the global chart the evaluation has broken out from the major resistance and is currently in an upward trajectory. Consequently, the market is in green with an average percentage of increase ranging around 9%. The biggest gainers are in double digits and the most notable increase among top 100 coins is Bitcoin Private with an increase of 40.59% in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has stayed around the same levels which indicates that the new capital has spread into the market widely as to include the altcoins who previously saw a decrease.  From yesterday’s low at $3785.5 the price of Bitcoin has increased by 12.38% measured to the current levels of $4226.  Looking at the hourly chart you can see that the price has indeed found its bottom yesterday on the third interaction with the horizontal support level at $3783.7. Since the final corrective Z wave has ended an impulsive 12345 in the upward direction begun and judging by the sub-waves it has a bit more to go potentially for another interaction with the horizontal resistance level at $4247 before undergoing a small correction. In the upcoming period, I would be expecting that the price pulls back a bit at first and then continue going upward to retest the descending channels support levels for resistance. Market sentiment Hourly chart technicals are signaling a buy.  Pivot points S3 2572.1 S2 3307.9 S1  3762.5 P 4498.3 R1 5234.1 R2 5688.7 R3 6424.5 From yesterday’s low at $267.49 the price of Bitcoin Cash has increased by 12.97% as the cryptocurrency is currently being traded at $303.  Looking at the hourly chart you can see a similar upward structure like in the case of Bitcoin. At the moment we can see that the price has reached the horizontal resistance line at $ 306.3 and the interaction with it resulted with a small decrease for now. As you can see the price action has formed a U shape which indicates a bottom and considering the horizontal level will serve as resistance we are now likely going to see a retracement which would be in combination with the U shape bottom a cup and handle pattern. After a pullback, I would be expecting that the price continues in an upward trajectory but we are yet to see how high will this recovery go. Market sentiment  Bitcoin Cash hourly chart technical indicators are bullish, with moving averages signaling a strong buy.  Pivot points S3 133.78 S2 300.46 S1 361.27 P 467.14 R1 527.95 R2 633.82 R3 800.50 From yesterday’s low at $53.64 the price of Monero has increased by 17.15% measured to the current levels of $62.67.  On the hourly chart, you can see that the price has broken the major resistance line much like it did on the charts of two major cryptos previously analyzed. Currently, the price is in an upward trajectory since a small pullback which is what I am expecting to see now for the price of Bitcoin Cash. The next horizontal resistance level in line is at the prior range support which is at $64.645. The price could stop increasing here because as you can see by the wick from the upside the selling pressure has already being experienced. Market sentiment Monero is in the buy zone.

Looking at the global chart you can see the similarities in the structure with all the major cryptos as well as the minor once. It looks like the down move has ended and that the recovery has started. First major resistance the evaluation has encountered and is currently struggling to pass is the prior lower high level. I believe that the evaluation will pullback to retest downtrend’s resistance line for support from which an increase is to be made to the next horizontal resistance level which is at around $142,571B and is the support from the consolidation range. After the interaction with the mentioned level we will see and evaluate the potential behind the upward move.",

On January 13, up to $3.6 million in crypto assets was transferred to an unknown digital wallet from Cryptopia without authorization. Upon discovery of the transfer by company employees, Cryptopia decided to shut down its website as efforts went into tracing the lost assets and what could have caused the hack. On January 14, the exchange posted a tweet informing its clients that the website was down due to the necessity of some “unscheduled maintenance.” Over time, the crypto trading platform repeatedly assured its users that trading would be back in a matter of days, as its engineering team was working on a lasting solution to the issue. However, the lack of communication from the company has raised suspicion from some quarters, as customers believe Cryptopia might not be telling the full story. The exchange confirmed the attack on January 15 via a tweet, calling the hack a “security breach.”  The digital asset platform is currently under maintenance, according to its last update. Also, all trading activities have already been reportedly suspended until the police force and the High Tech Crime Consortium (HTCC), an agency that deals with cybercrime, are done with their investigation.  The police force has established a physical presence at the Colombo Street headquarters of Cryptopia, but contrary to various reports published by the local media, they have not placed the building under a lockdown. Last year saw an upsurge in the number of digital asset platforms that were hacked. According to an Anti-Money Laundering Report by intelligence firm CipherTrace, the total crypto-related attacks recorded in the first three quarters 2018 saw the loss of about $927 million worth of digital assets. Still, it looks like 2019 might be picking up right where 2018 stopped. Just three days into the New Year, Dublin’s local tram system—Luas—had its website hacked, where the details of thousands of users were supposedly stolen. According to the Irish Times, the attacker had sent ransom messages asking for a single Bitcoin (BTC) unit in exchange for surrendering control of the whole system. The attacker threatened to make the publications of private data public if the ransom request wasn’t met within the stipulated time. The local tech department was reportedly able to make modifications to the website to remove the message. However, the page remains offline as of this writing. On January 5, U.S. crypto trading platform Coinbase suddenly stopped trading Ethereum Classic (ETC) after the exchange discovered that the currency’s underlying blockchain had been the victim of a 51% attack. Crypto exchange platform Gate.io also reported that it had lost 40,000 ETC tokens (worth about $220,000). Assuring users of their safety, the exchange also said that it would take care of all affected users’ losses. After days of speculations, ARS Technica reported that the total number of ETC tokens stolen as result of the ETC 51% attack was about 85,000, with a reported worth of around $500,000. On January 12, Gate.io reported that the ETC hacker had returned $100,000 in ETC tokens to the exchange. The exchange claimed that it had no explanation for the hacker’s sudden “change of heart,” speculating that the hack might have been carried out by a white hat hacker. In the release, Gate.io wrote, “If the attacker didn’t run it for profit, he might be a white hacker who wanted to remind people the risks in blockchain consensus and hashing power security.”",

        "passage": "Iran’s government is looking to provide tax breaks for bitcoin miners in the country. This move is the latest in a series of steps geared towards supporting the local crypto industry as a way of boosting the country’s economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues to see increased activity as the network hash rate approaches unprecedented levels. Participants in the market are even expanding their outlay with numerous data centers going live across the globe.  According to Iranian English news platform Financial Tribune, the country is set to offer tax holidays to bitcoin mining firms. Iran’s National Tax Administration (INTA) says that bitcoin miners who repatriate their foreign earnings will be eligible for tax exemptions. Usually, repatriating offshore earnings (converting overseas revenue into the local currency of the country where the company is based) comes with a significant corporate tax burden. For this reason, many companies elect not to repatriate their foreign revenue. As previously reported by Blockonomi, Iran’s government classifies cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity. Thus, bitcoin miners in the country have to pay federal taxes. The move to provide tax breaks in exchange for repatriated overseas earnings might constitute a significant stimulus for Iran’s fiat currency. Tehran has struggled with capital control policies amid a weakening economy and the return of U.S. sanctions. Iranian bitcoin miners, however, believe that the government shouldn’t have to worry about capital flight from their activities because 70% of their revenue ends being used to cover production costs. In recent times, authorities in Tehran seem to have stopped short of legalizing cryptocurrency as a whole in the country. The government has legalized cryptocurrency mining, creating a special electricity tariff for the activity. There was a slight standoff brewing between bitcoin miners and the government over power consumption. Data centers thronged to mosques across the country in a bid to enjoy free electricity. Iran’s electricity tariff is highly subsidized being more than 80% lower than the global average. Thus, bitcoin miners continue to flock into the country in search of cheap electricity. Even with the creation of a separate fee structure for cryptocurrency miners, the charges might still be significantly lower than in other countries where bitcoin mining is popular. Such is the extent of the increase in Iranian crypto mining activity that it decreased the global utilization of renewable energy in bitcoin mining. Data from Coinshares report saw a slight drop in this regard. Iran’s electricity generation is mostly from fossil fuel sourced from the country’s large oil deposits. While the government is encouraging bitcoin mining, cryptocurrencies themselves are still outlawed in the country. Citizens cannot use bitcoin and other digital coins are a means of payment. Also, mining companies can only sell mined cryptos on overseas exchanges. For Iranian authorities, encouraging crypto commerce could further dilute capital control efforts. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining activity continues to increase with the blockchain network hash rate setting new all-time highs. The Bitcoin Network hash rate is almost at 100 quintillion hashes per second. Hash rate refers to the computing power used to secure the blockchain network. To put things into perspective, Bitcoin’s current hash rate exceeds the approximate total number of grains of sand on the earth by more than 10 times. Companies like Northern Bitcoin are also expanding their financial outlay in the market, establishing new data centers. The emphasis continues to be on sustainable bitcoin mining using renewable energy sources. Reports say mining centers are becoming a buyer of last resort for clean energy.",

        "passage": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has barred banks from in any way dealing in or facilitating those dealing in cryptocurrencies with immediate effect. Citizens will no longer be able to buy digital currency using their banking facilities as the central bank has banned them from “dealing with or providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or selling virtual currencies”. The section of the statement dealing with “Virtual Currencies” read: In announcing fiscal policy during a bi-monthly release outlining plans for 2018 – 2019, the Reserve said that any entity that falls under their jurisprudence may not provide services to anyone – individual or company – that buys, sells or otherwise deals with digital coins. While India has previously made damning noises about digital coins, the country is also a blockchain fanatic, looking to lead the way in blockchain application and development. India was a “touch and go” case study in the effects of regulatory unfolding impacting national cryptocurrency enthusiasm, but has now fallen into a slump in comparison to the rest of the world. Global virtual currency sentiment has matured and is now broadly positive and growing.  Indian finance minister Arun Jaitle, Image by Forbes  The latest stance by the RBI pushes the country back, aligning it with authoritarian regimes like China. Tim Draper in an interview with Economic Times, said : (If) India is thinking of making (cryptocurrency) illegal… other countries will raise their hands to get all the (blockchain) entrepreneurs (from India). If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake. The policy shift means that fiat to cryptocurrency conversion in India through exchanges will soon cease to exist. Direct deposits or cross-border facilitation with family or associates acting as agents or using decentralized exchanges like Localbitcoins and Bisq will be the only routes for Indian citizens to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. This is essentially a step backward, taking India back to pre-exchange era. The financial services head of EY India, Abizer Diwanji, confirmed: “A person will not be able to transfer money from his savings account to his cryptowallet.” The RBI is on record as constantly warning the population of associated risks when buying, selling or otherwise trading or transacting with virtual currencies. While it didn’t dampen enthusiasm at the time, those warnings have now come home to roost, with the banker deciding that consumer protection outweighs any other civil liberty in the matter of digital coins. In a now-typical stance emerging from lawmakers all over the world – one that shows how little they understand of cryptocurrencies – the RBI announcement did acknowledge the value of the technical platform of blockchain. That said, cryptocurrencies, in spite of their underlying construct, have alarmed the central bank in its considerations of money laundering, financial market stability and other broad consumer concerns. RBI, in line with many nations’ central banks, feels a keen obligation to protect consumers in terms of its mandate. All central banks on record consistently point to the Wild West nature of some exchanges and ICOs and fear the unregulated arena’s ability to enable large-scale fraud and other criminal activity. Banks that currently offer services in the form of transactional or investment accounts that hold funds derived of cryptocurrency dealings will need to give those customers reasonable notice of termination of services, as allowed for in the announcement. The central banker will issue a further bulletin detailing the necessary steps for banks to extricate themselves from such relationships within a specified time period. The announcement by the RBI also included mention of a possible national cryptocurrency, in a further demonstration of regulators’ desire to keep the same ship afloat in turbulent times. It seems central banks actually don’t have a problem with virtual currencies, as long as they own them. In January 2018, India’s central bank noted cryptocurrency’s impact on the formal banking sector as an item for concern. The RBI warned India’s banks, instructing them to scrutinize more closely transactions made by individuals, companies and exchanges that were dealing in digital coins. In a previous press release, the RBI seemed to address end users more than the banks themselves, saying “… any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.” Usually Indian markets would trade cryptocurrencies at a premium of 10-15 % over international markets, however post this announcement markets immediately crashed by around 25%. Currently bitcoin is trading in India at 399,900 INR ( 6140 USD ) whereas it’s trading for 6642 USD in international markets at the time of writing this. The effects are not observed in International markets because India accounts for only around 2% of the global trade volume.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin developers Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra, and Sanket Kanjalkar have created a new programming language that can help bitcoin transactions become more versatile. Announced on August 19th to the [bitcoin-dev] mailing list, Miniscript relies on the simple smart contract language already usable in Bitcoin, Script, to extend the conditional possibilities around bitcoin payments through a mixture of hash locks, time locks, and signatures.  “It’s a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling analysis, composition, generic signing and more,” Wuille explained.  Wuille added that Miniscript was “designed for Bitcoin as it exists today,” and no consensus changes were necessary to use it. The developers said they planned to “support future script changes Bitcoin may include” so as to evolve with the blockchain. Wuille later noted on Twitter that the new language could eventually be rolled into the Bitcoin Core repository if the Bitcoin community agreed to it. “I’ll work on incorporating parts of this in Bitcoin Core if that’s desired (I believe it could be very useful), but ideally it gets included in many pieces of wallet technology,” he said.  Notably, the developers created a so-called “policy compiler” for Miniscript. Among other things, the tool lets users get an idea for when conditional bitcoin transactions can be spent. Pieter Wuille and Andrew Poelstra are rockstar developers in the Bitcoin community (Sanket is an up-and-comer in his own right!). That’s not only because of what they’ve already built but also because the technology they’re still working on that could shape the future of Bitcoin for years to come. Some of that tech includes in-progress developments like Schnorr Signatures and Taproot. The former is an efficient algorithm for cryptographic signatures, and the latter would make bitcoin smart contract transactions private by making them appear like normal transactions. In the wake of revealing Miniscript on Monday, Wuille that the project wasn’t directly related to Taproot but did provide the participating developers with insights on how to improve the Script language itself, which could lead to wider implications later in the Bitcoin ecosystem: Another technology being worked on generally in the Bitcoin community is PSBTs, or partially-signed bitcoin transactions. Wuille also noted that the advancements made possible by the new scripting language could work in a complementary fashion with such transactions. “My hope is that Miniscript, together with things like PSBT can reduce some of the barriers between pieces of software,” he said.  One of the most esteemed coders in the entire cryptocurrency space has come aboard Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s bitcoin outfit. Square Crypto — the recently launched open-source bitcoin development arm of popular mainstream payments company Square — announced their hiring of Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo on August 20th. Corallo later confirmed his new employment on Twitter.  In being one of the world’s leading Bitcoin experts and builders, Corallo brings a veteran presence to the upstart development team that only hired its first employee, former Google product director Steve Lee, in June. The project comes as part of Jack Dorsey’s person mission to contribute to building out the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin,” Square CEO Dorsey had said in announcing Square Crypto back in the spring.",

        "passage": "The Ethereum network has the chance to become a new and increasingly important kind of public infrastructure. The latest proof the winds are blowing in that direction? Banco Santander, the largest bank in Spain and the 16th largest bank in the world, just deployed the “first end-to-end blockchain bond” using the smart contract platform. Announced by the Spanish multinational commercial bank on September 12th, the bond will notably live entirely on Ethereum.  The Madrid-based bank itself will be the issuer, and $20 million USD worth of bonds will accordingly be released. The bond will offer a “a quarterly coupon of 1,98%” through the bank’s Securities Services department, which is “acting as tokenization agent and custodian of the cryptographic keys” associated with the offering. Likewise, Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), the institution’s arm for international enterprise clients, served as the “dealer for the [bond’s] issuance, continuing the work which started in Santander’s blockchain lab in 2016.” Moreover, Santander will track the actual cash used to buy the bonds on Ethereum’s mainnet and the aforementioned quarterly coupons will similarly be tracked on-chain.  “The bank issued the bond directly onto the blockchain and the bond will also continue to exist only on the blockchain: a first step towards a potential secondary market for mainstream security tokens in the future,” Banco Santander said in a Thursday press release.  Those are tall words from one of the largest banks in the world. But when it comes to disintermediation, the institution is talking more like a cypherpunk and less like one of the international stage’s biggest banks. “Thanks to this automation, the one-year maturity bond has reduced the number of intermediaries required in the process, making the transaction faster, more efficient and simpler,” Banco Santander said on the news. The bank’s chief financial officer, José García Cantera, added: The blockchain space as a whole is still fledgling, and the backers of Ethereum are still very much so trying to position the platform to be useful for many people from many walks of life. With that said, it’s no secret that Ethereum has long been fingered as an ideal platform for the neutral issuance of financial products. Bonds are no exception in that regard. So somewhat unsurprisingly, the Ethereum community has started to see some major traction on the bonds’s front. Back in the spring, Societe Generale — popularly referred to as SocGen — released €100 million EUR in bonds — dubbed “obligations de financement de l’habitat” — as security tokens on Ethereum. As the bank explained at the time of the announcement: Santander appears to be increasingly interested in blockchain tech. Back in May, news broke that a dozen major banks had collectively invested $50 million into Fnality, a startup that was working on a blockchain project around the utility settlement coin (USC) project. Speculation mounted that Santander was involved, as the bank had been involved with UBS Group AG, which had originally sponsored the USC initiative. With the latest bond news, it appears in the least that Santander is doing more than just its homework on blockchain tech.",

        "passage": "Call it Open Finance. Call it DeFi. Call it whatever you’d like. In any case, a major trend in the Ethereum ecosystem lately is disintermediating complex financial operations to make it easier than ever for users to turn money services into a “do it yourself,” or DIY, activity. The latest developments in that vein this week come via Staked and the Universal Market Access (UMA) project, both of which have rolled out new services that are likely at the tip of the spear where DeFi innovations are concerned.  With regard to Staked, the company just announced its new Robo-Advisor for Yield (RAY) service, which is comprised of a series of smart contracts and is designed to automatically funnel a user’s investments into the highest yielding investment opportunities in Ethereum DeFi at any given time.  To use the service, a trader must deposit ether (ETH), DAI, or USD Coin (USDC) into the provided RAY contract and thereafter select what DeFi “opportunities should be considered.” The system then automatically moves around those funds to take advantages of the best yielding outlets at the time. The plan is for the service to eventually move beyond mere lending and into different cryptoeconomy activities like the coming Dai savings rate, the Staked team explained: Like its name suggests, the company supports Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain projects like Tezos, Cosmos, and Livepeer. The startup is backed by investors like Winklevoss Capital, the Digital and Coinbase Ventures. Also in the news this week is the UMA Protocol team’s new Synthetic Token Builder service, which allows users to “build tokens that can track anything with a price feed.”  For now, the service is only live on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet, meaning its not out in the wild just yet. However, the testnet version is an excellent indication of the kind of products that are coming — and from anyone that wants to release them. As UMA Protocol’s financial engineer Regina Cai explained on the news: How’s it work exactly? Like so, Cai said in a Medium post: Such a dynamic will allow users to make a wide variety of unique tokens, ranging from tokens that are pegged to the Chinese yuan to tokens that are pegged to Facebook’s stock price. Within the cryptoverse, the UMA Protocol project is known for launching the USStocks project earlier this year, which created a token that represented “synthetic ownership of an index of the 500 largest exchange-listed US stocks.” “USStocks is an exciting example of how decentralized finance can unlock economic opportunities for people regardless of geography or income level,” MakerDAO chief executive officer Rune Christensen said at the time. Relatedly, whatever happens with the UMA team’s latest service, it’s clear that the frictionless nature of tokenization continues to march on.",

        "passage": "Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee is on a world tour. No, he isn’t pumping out pop songs or signing books. The Wall Street analyst is touting the good word of Bitcoin, and why the cryptocurrency market is ready to be catapulted into its next bull run, expected to be the biggest yet. Most recently, Lee, who became prominent in the digital asset space after becoming the poster child for Bitcoin optimism in 2017, appeared on Yahoo Finance to elaborate on why BTC is and will do so well. This is the umpteenth time he has made a Bitcoin-related appearance on mainstream media in the past six weeks.  During a Monday segment of “On The Move”, Lee sat down, clad in his navy-blue suit, to try and reason why Bitcoin has been outperforming traditional assets as of late. He suggests that much of the recent move has a lot to do with uncertainty on the geopolitical and macroeconomic stage, which has recently been slammed by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, Brexit, and the financial collapses of Venezuela, Argentina, and other nations. The Fundstrat co-founder notes that Bitcoin is acting much like “digital gold”, giving investors a chance to hedge their bets against crisis with a revolutionary asset that is digital through scarce. He isn’t the first to have suggested that the recently geopolitical trends have been a tailwind for Bitcoin and its ilk. A report from the South China Morning Post recently pointed out that after Donald Trump, the president of the U.S., announced tariff changes on Chinese imports, BTC began to rally. Simultaneously, the yuan purportedly fell to its lowest level in six months, as China looked to move against Trump. Garrick Hileman of Blockchain.com told the outlet that the Yuan has traded inversely to Bitcoin in the past. And most recently, Barry Silbert, the chief executive of industry conglomerate Digital Currency Group, told Fortune’s “Balancing The Ledger” that in this trade war, Bitcoin is acting as a “non-correlated asset”. He looks to Brexit news correlating with movements in the BTC market to further illustrate his point that this move may have much to do with geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Lee’s points, along with those made by his colleagues, can be contrasted to those made by Erik Voorhees, the chief executive of ShapeShift. Last week, we reported that Voorhees suggested to Bloomberg TV that the recent move is a result of investors across the board coming to the conclusion that the bottom is finally in, and have begun to scale into the market as a unit. Let’s say that the geopolitical strains die down, does that mean BTC will return lower again? According to Lee, likely not. In fact, he asserted that by many measures, “crypto winter” is over, no questions asked. In a recent Twitter post, the Fundstrat representative gave 13 reasons why the bear market is over. Some of these important reasons include the fact that Bitcoin quickly returned to $8,000 after the $1,700 dump on Bitstamp; the Bitcoin Misery Index passing above 89, a sign only seen in bull markets; a grow in on-chain activity and volumes, which historically have preceded rallies; and the fact that Bitcoin’s chart recently saw a bullish “golden cross” pattern” while BTC moved above its 200-day moving average in spectacular fashion.  And most recently, Lee noted that the fact that Bitcoin futures contracts on BitMEX for June and September have begun to trade well above spot prices is the fourteenth sign that winter is over. And from here, the analyst expects for BTC to post new all-time highs by 2020.",

        "passage": "You can count on the Sichuan Basin in Northwestern China being rainy every autumn. The question is: how rainy? This year, the seasonal downpours are proving particularly torrential, as extreme flooding in recent days has led to evacuations and fatalities in the region. Also affected have been bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining operations in the area, according to local reports. Notably, Sichuan is one of the world’s biggest centers for bitcoin mining activity.  Red Li, co-founder of Chinese crypto publication 8btc, confirmed that a few mining facilities appeared to be “wiped out” from the flooding. Li posted to Twitter several photos depicting destroyed local infrastructure and washed out, mud-covered bitcoin mining rigs.  The Beijing-based Poolin, currently the fourth largest bitcoin mining pool in the world, also highlighted the catastrophe. The company posted videos to its Twitter account showing what appeared to be a Sichuan mining facility being enveloped by flooding and workers digging through muddy rigs in the aftermath.  Back in June, cryptocurrency research company Coinshares published a report suggesting the majority of the world’s bitcoin mining operations are powered by renewable energy sources. With that said, many Chinese miners rely on hydropower for cheap renewable energy. That cheap hydropower has a catch: it depends on Chinese wet seasons being wet. Many of these miners and their businesses depend on being located in areas where heavy seasonal rain is not just the norm, but the needed reality. If Sichuan was dry year round, miners wouldn’t be relying on hydropower there (but solar power would then be an option). So sometimes when it rains it pours, and when disastrous amounts of rainfall hit popular mining centers in China, these operations’ lifesource becomes a possible death knell like was seen this week. Some Sichuan mining facilities were notably rocked by flooding last year, too — it’s the name of the game, it seems. Fortunately, the damage appears to have been isolated to a few facilities. Among other things, that means the Bitcoin hash rate hasn’t been affected much by the flooding. As of August 21st, the hash rate hovered around 77.5 quintillion hashes per second according to Blockchain.com — not far from the 82.5 quintillion hashes per second seen on August 18th. Flooding in Sichuan hardly qualifies as a black swan event because such flooding is almost expected to happen. Still, mining operations that take preparations against the region’s seasonal fury can still find their efforts reduced to rubble by nature’s power because only so much can be done in the face of natural disasters. Flooding can hit hard and fast and acutely take local populaces by surprise, for one. Zooming out on bitcoin, for the cryptocurrency to work as a non-sovereign global money system, it has to be able to keep chugging along even if parts of its network are affected by disasters or black swan events. If a central spoke on the centralized VISA network got affected by a hack or extreme weather, an entire continent of users might lose access to their money for a time. On the flip side, flooding can hit a bitcoin mining capital and Bitcoin doesn’t even come close to losing any uptime. Such anti-fragility is one of the cryptocurrency’s biggest value propositions. Some disregard the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining because they point to the network’s reliance on renewable energy. But it’s not so simple, and China’s weather patterns show why. When rainy seasons give way to dry seasons in China, many miners shift from using hydropower to burning fossil fuels, e.g. through coal plants. PwC blockchain expert Alex de Vries has previously argued that dynamic could lead to the “construction of new coal-based power plants” in China, which would grow Bitcoin’s environmental implications.",

        "passage": "Would you believe it if someone told you that you could turn $1000 into $3650 in one year, every year, absolutely guaranteed? What about turning $10,000 into $36,500? Odds are likely you would be suspicious of such claims given that a typical well performing Wall Street investment would average out to about 4% per year. But in the world of Ponzi schemes and HYIP scams, these kinds of promises are the norm. So join us as we dig into an apparent Ponzi scheme that’s promising 1% per day every day, for life.  If you’re not familiar with the term, a Ponzi scheme is a kind of scam investment in which potential investors (victims) are tricked into getting involved and typically lose all their invested capital. These scams promise incredibly high rates of return, daily payouts, and guaranteed profits. Ponzi schemes have been around for a long time, but unfortunately they found a new home and a new batch of fresh victims in cryptocurrency. The most infamous of these crypto Ponzi schemes was of course BitConnect which crashed and burned not long ago, taking untold millions of dollars of investors money with it. But even with the widely discussed BitConnect hitting headlines everywhere, it seems that scammers are still out in force and new schemes are popping up all the time.  Bitconnect Scam The other day we came across another apparent scam, this one claiming it makes its money through real estate and offering guaranteed profits with no risk. The site we’re looking at today is WestLand Storage (westlandstorage.com). This site claims that it is a real estate investment platform in which investors can purchase individual square feet of real estate which is then supposedly rented or leased out. The profits from doing this are then returned to the investor at a rate of 1% per day. The company claims that this profit is absolutely guaranteed, and that there is no risk of any kind of loss whatsoever. If your mental alarm bells aren’t going off already, they should be. The company claims to have been around for 17 years, and says that they have a worldwide network of real estate which is up for tokenization and investment. To identify a Ponzi scheme, you usually only need to find two things. The first is an offering of a ridiculous and unsustainable payout rate, and the second is a claim that these earnings are guaranteed and risk-free. On the site, we found both of those.  Unsustainable high-yields, Image from westlandstorage.com  Guaranteed profits, image from westlandstorage.com According to this fantasy, renting out real estate can yield an investor 1% of their total investment per day. Now let’s imagine how that would work in the real world. Suppose that you were to rent a residential property. Would you expect to pay 1% of the total value of the real estate you are renting, every single day? Let’s do a simple example. Let’s say that you’re renting a small single-family residential home in rural America. The total value of that home is $250,000. If what WestLand storage was promising were true and accurately reflected the real estate market, then you would expect to pay 1% per day to rent this home. That means your rent would be $2500 a day. Going further, that would mean to rent your home, it would cost $75,000 a month. At that price, you might as well buy the home as you’re going to end up paying its entire price after just a few months. In the real world (and not the Ponzi scheme fantasy world) you could reasonably expect to pay anywhere from $1000-$2000 a month to rent a small residential home outside of a big city in the US. That’s per month, mind you, not per day. Another major indicator of a scam of this sort is the general low effort and total lack of quality control visible in the site’s design. Most often, this manifests itself in the form of numerous spelling and grammar errors all over the site, as well as the near exclusive use of stock images. We found a number of major spelling and grammar errors on the site such as this one:  How musch, indeed!   And this grammar mistake:  While many blockchain projects come from non-native English speaking countries, if these projects are serious about appearing professional they will likely hire someone to edit or spell check their white paper or website. These types of Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, typically only exist for 3 to 6 months, or at most one year, before they collapse. As such, these scam site operators simply do not care to put in the effort to make sure their spelling and grammar are correct. Typically, these sorts of scams will spread through word-of-mouth via affiliate marketing links. For this particular site, they seem to have paid a number of smaller crypto news websites to place an identical paid press release (which is also written quite poorly) on each one. The exact same press release is linked on 9 other websites from westlandstorage.com, and dozens more can be found via a search. This includes a few sites which appear to have provided a translation for the press release. You can tell because they all contain the name “Mark Zuckerberg”. The press release ends with an alleged quote from someone named James Griffin of Today Real Estate Analyst Company. A quick search revealed only links to the various copies of this press release.  Search results for “Today Real Estate Analyst Company” Typically when a crypto news website directly posts a press release they will include a statement indicating that the release was provided by an outside third party, and that the site does not in any way endorse or approve of the content within. For example on bitcoinist.com, such a statement is included with the WestLand Storage PR piece. It’s safe to say that this particular scam decided to have these paid press releases placed on a number of websites in order to give them an air of legitimacy. However, they have not received any actual endorsement from these sites that wasn’t paid for. It’s unfortunate that cryptocurrency seems to inevitably attract all sorts of different kinds of scams and schemes. That’s why it’s important to always keep your investment expectations realistic. And if anyone starts promising guaranteed returns or 1% daily or more, turn around and walk away.",

        "passage": "If there was any question to the notoriety that cryptocurrencies have generated, one need not look any further than a recent story that was published in Japanese news outlet Jiji.com. The G20 is meeting soon in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and apparently taxing cryptos will be on the agenda. Jiji.com reports that the G20 has drafted a document that calls for, “a taxation system for cross-border electronic payment services.” The details of the system are still very much unknown, and implementing any global taxation system would be a daunting task.  As Jiji.com is a Japanese-based news outlet, they focused on how these laws could affect Japanese businesses and individuals. At the moment, companies who do, “not have a factory or other base in Japan,” are immune from local taxation. Clearly, the initiative proposed by the G20 would likely change that. There are numerous hurdles to overcome if cryptos are going to be taxed, or even regulated to any great degree. Today there are numerous above-the-board crypto exchanges, but they generally cater to a clientele that is looking to invest or speculate. Cryptos are a nearly perfect way to launder money, and there is absolutely nothing stopping them from being used to do so. Of course, this is basically the case for the established system as well. The Goldman-Sachs Implicated, 1MDB scandal, took place with the cooperation of US banking executives, who are subject to a strict regulatory environment. The US regulations that exist to prevent fraud and money laundering did nothing to stop it, which put the role of banking regulation into serious question. A tax on cryptos or an international regulatory framework is likely going to be extremely complex, and much like international laws, very difficult to enforce. The rising tensions between major nations is also cause for concern, especially when it comes to laws that would require a high degree of cooperation to be effective. People all over the world are already paying taxes on just about everything, cryptos included. One young crypto investor found out how complex the existing tax laws can be, and is on the hook for around $400,000 USD.  Read: Student Cryptocurrency Trader Turns Huge Profits in to a $400k Tax Bill A young man in the USA was initially lucky and bought around 125,000 ETH at $50 USD in 2017. His good luck continued, and by the end of his run, the assets he bought ad sold netted him a profit of almost $1 million USD. According to Coinbase (and the IRS), “Gains on digital currency sales and exchanges are taxable in the US. For reference, here are the IRS guidelines for reporting digital asset gains. We understand taxes for digital currency can be complicated, so we updated our tax tools to make reporting easier.” We all know what happened next. The bottom fell out of the market, and like many traders, the young man in question keep on going. As it stands today, his digital assets are worth around $125,000, and he owes the US government a lot more than that. This is just one example of how government regulations can create nightmare scenarios, and there are few safeguards in place to help people stay on the right side of a very murky body of law. International crypto taxes would likely be even more difficult to understand, or even enforce. There is another issue that regulators that want to tax cryptos will almost certainly face. As the last few decades have shown, there are no shortage of tax loopholes out there. If there was a movement towards greater international taxation, it would likely be met with even more ingenious ways of avoiding taxes. The Panama Papers showed that many of the highest people in governments are using tax-avoidance techniques which seem simple when compared to what is possible when cryptos enter the equation. An asset that is designed to be anonymous will be taxed and regulated isn’t going to be straightforward at all, any attempt to do so will probably cost a tremendous amount of money, and be moderately effective, at best.",

        "passage": "Chainlink (LINK), the decentralized oracle middleware project that helps smart contracts interact with real-world data, has been among the best performing crypto projects so far in 2019. Of course, bitcoin (BTC) has been the one leading the cryptoeconomy up as of late, being up 11 percent on the week, up 18 percent on the month, and up 73 percent over the last three months. Yet LINK has been putting up similarly optimistic numbers — the crypto’s price is up 43 percent on the week, up 29 percent on the month, and up 54 percent over the last three months in kind.  The crypto, which now enjoys enjoys a market capitalization of approximately $240 million USD, is currently priced at $0.068 — now more than halfway to its all-time price high of $1.28, which was reached during the peak of the cryptoeconomy’s last bull run in January 2018. As the crypto ecosystem has seemingly started to turn bullish once more, many of the top coins’ prices have started to show new signs of life in the market. But LINK, a lesser known project generally speaking, has been one of the better performers recently — why? The answer to that question is undoubtedly a combination of things. First, Chainlink is tackling decentralized oracles, which could end up taking smart contract tech to the mainstream. It’s also the largest and most reputable project working on oracles, with Chainlink’s technical maestro Sergey Nazarov being a respected mind in the ecosystem. A factor surely at play is Chainlink’s small, underdog status. Traders have likely looked at LINK as a coin that can grow higher and faster than top 10 crypto projects that have already become well established. Thus, Chainlink could provide a more aggressive bet than other coins at present. Another dynamic to consider is that the Chainlink team has been quietly racking up partnerships around the space. Decrypt recently profiled these partnerships, of which there are now approximately 30. Chainlink’s latest partnership announcement came on May 9th, as the team and the builders of the Hedera Hashgraph decentralized ledger declared they had inked a deal. Specifically, the agreement will entail Chainlink helping to implement its oracle network into the enterprise-minded Hedera Hashgraph ledger. As such, those writing Hashgraph smart contracts will be able to leverage Chainlink’s oracles in the future.  Read: What is Hedera Hashgraph? Jordan Fried — Hedera’s SVP of Global Business Development — hailed the collaboration as an advancement for the possibilities of smart contracts in general: The Hedera team also noted that the team-up would give Chainlink’s tech exposure to some of the “largest global enterprises” operating today. The debate is still on as to whether the cryptoeconomy has entered a full-fledged bull market cycle. If it has, though, Chainlink seems like the kind of coin worth keeping an eye on. Chris Burniske, a partner at the venture capital firm Placeholder, recently outlined how bitcoin seems to rally first, at which point traders disseminate their profits into altcoins that are viewed as “depressed” — i.e. undervalued.  In his associated Twitter thread, Burniske didn’t mention any specific altcoin by name — “pick your alt,” he said. Yet the possible tinderbox conditions around Chainlink seems to make it precisely the kind of “depressed” altcoin that could help lead the cryptoeconomy’s next altcoin cycle if the bitcoin price continues to push up. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, and it’s impossible to say what will happen next in these markets. But in the very least, it’s clear Chainlink is an interesting project to watch going forward.",

        "passage": "Members and colleagues of SmartContract, the team behind the Chainlink decentralized oracle project, unveiled research this week on a new privacy boosting DeFi tool dubbed Mixicles. In a paper released by SmartContract researchers Sergey Nazarov, Alex Coventry, Steve Ellis, Brendan Magauran, and technical advisors Ari Juels and Lorenz Breidenbach, Mixicles rely on oracles to “report” on payouts of inputted payments rather than randomized shuffling as traditional cryptocurrency mixers do.  “Mixicles are designed for the purpose of preserving privacy for financial instruments, not the concealment of cryptocurrency movements,” the authors explained. In other words, a Mixicle as outlined would be ideal for enterprises that want to have operational auditability while also having the privacy of its blockchain operations ensured. To this end, the researchers noted: That’s where Mixicles aim for: toward privacy and regulatory compliance. Moreover, Mixicles are also interesting for “their avoidance of expensive cryptography and complicated contract structures,” meaning they can run efficiently without being resource intensive. Notably, this new DeFi privacy tool hasn’t only been designed with efficiency in privacy in mind — it’s also been specifically structured to be compatible with the Chainlink decentralized oracle network. Yet Mixicles are only a proposed piece of a wider privacy approach, as the instruments have their limitations. For one, Mixicles don’t provide privacy for an input address’s prior activities or for an output address’s later activities. Also, Mixicles can allow users to report “oracle malfeasance” but not to prevent such malfeasance from occurring in the first place. Even still, if the technology takes off it will likely become a welcomed addition to the blockchain ecosystem’s growing privacy options. For example, the tech’s researchers have described it as relatively agnostic implementation-wise and capable of being integrated with complementary solutions, like the Zether privacy protocol for Ethereum (of which JP Morgan has developed its own version, Anonymous Zether). Whatever happens, the authors noted there is more work to be done: As decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have made a comeback in the Ethereum community in 2019, a growing topic of discussion has been how to protect the privacy of DAO members during organizational votes and beyond. A new potential option? Sempahore, a “zero-knowledge signalling gadget” designed by a trio of developers to allow Ethereum users to confidentially interact with arbitrary strings of data. Such a system would provide DAO users the privacy they have been calling for lately, though Semaphore’s possibilities go beyond just signalling. “In the near future, it can be used for other privacy-enhancing applications such as anonymous login, anonymous DAOs, anonymous voting, and journalism,” Ethereum developer Koh Wei Jie explained of the project on September 2nd.  Thus the “gadget” is yet another domino to drop in the Ethereum community’s race toward privacy optimizations — a race that’s recently been heating up. For instance, the coming Istanbul upgrade for Ethereum contains some optimizations that will make it more affordable to make encrypted transactions on the platform.",

        "passage": "Hackers have reportedly stolen nearly $10 million worth of Ripple (XRP) from about 100 XRP ledger wallets on GateHub, as reported in a preliminary statement issued by the CEO of crypto wallet service provider, Enej Pungercar, on June 6. Gatehub disclosed, in the statement, that they were notified by customers whose wallets were compromised. Estimated count of all affected users was about 100, but the platform has stated that it has not been confirmed that all the affected XRP wallets were hosted on GateHub.  At first, the company couldn’t point its finger towards any nefarious activity on the platform but when it dug deeper, it formed a hypothesis of possible ways the attackers got access to the encrypted keys. It wasn’t through brute force or suspicious logins. The company stated that they discovered an increase in application programming interface (API) calls coming from a small number of IP addresses. Gatehub is reportedly still working with law enforcement and other security professionals to figure out what happened and whether their system remains at risk. The firm hopes to get things back to normal soon. Gatehub community member, Thomas Silkjær, who reportedly warned the platform about a possible breach, published a report  about the hack, stating that: Silkjær also disclosed that approximately 23,200,000 XRP had been stolen from 80–90 victims, of which 13,100,000 XRP have been laundered through exchanges and mixer services, as at the time that the report was published. To prevent further breaches, Gatehub has disabled all access tokens on June 1st after the suspicious API calls were stopped. However, the question on the minds of the cryptocurrency owners at large is whether the platform will regain the trust that their users invested in them and their platform, as breaches like this may be hard to recover from. Now that users have been urged to suspend activities on  their GateHub XRP wallets, subscriber numbers will definitely take a plunge, and many may resort to alternative web wallet services. While it is admirable that the management decided to be transparent with their information sources, it does not speak well of Gatehub’s administration and security that the users noticed the breach before they did, so that may not work in their favor as well. With this incident, 2019 seems to be quickly gaining ground as the year of crypto hacks. Increasing reports of hacks and breaches are circulating, and while it may be an indicator of the growth in the cryptocurrency sector in more countries, it is also a signal that security on exchange platforms and wallet providers needs to step up. Plus, for new crypto investors, picking a platform to get a web wallet could become a problem. One wallet provider who won’t lose sleep thinking about hackers is Komodo. The crypto wallet provider successfully hacked its own customers, following notification of a potential breach that could have resulted in the theft of funds worth nearly $13 million, broken down to 8 million komodo (KMD) tokens and 96 bitcoin.",

        "passage": "A judge has ruled that the $21.6 million that has been the basis of a dispute between a Canadian bank and a cryptocurrency exchange will be handed over to the Ontario Superior Court, according to a court document. QuadrigaCX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, which had its access to $21.6 million kept in its business account denied by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in January 2018. The bank also froze the accounts of Custodian Inc., the payment processor employed by the exchange about the same.  Last December, CIBC reported that the Custodian Inc. accounts witnessed a surge in activity, with 388 individuals depositing $51.8 million between December 4th, 2017 and February 20t, 2018. Some of the money was eventually withdrawn, with roughly $21.6 million being left. Reports by The Globe and Mail revealed that CIBC froze the accounts, because the bank was unable to ascertain the real owners of the funds, before requesting for the court to take possession of the funds in the interim. The bank also asked for the court to establish the rightful owners of the funds between Custodian Inc. and a total of 388 individuals who made deposits into the exchange for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. However, QuadrigaCX continued to posit that a large chunk of the funds that were in contention belonged to the exchange, and that the bank was wrong to freeze any of its accounts. According to a court document, the trading platform urged that the court should not yield to the claims of the bank, stating that they were nothing but invidious and unverified conjectures that the transactions were questionable. QuadrigaCX believes the CIBC decided to freeze the funds of their customers deliberately. The exchange also accused the bank of looking for different- and illegal- means of further prolonging their ability to hold these funds while also trying to make an act which should not have happened initially to look rational. The company informed its customers via email that various Canadian banks had colluded to make its operations difficult by restricting its efforts to access the funds that were available in its savings accounts. It claimed the gang up was to prevent the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by various players in the Canadian economy. In a court ruling that was issued on the 9th of November, Judge Glenn Hainey of the Ontario Superior Court corroborated the position of the CIBC that the owners of the funds are unclear. The judge ordered that the money should be transferred from the bank to the Accountant of the Superior Court in order or the court to be able to trace who owns the money. However, the judge also declined to state whether the actions of the bank in freezing the accounts was improper. Judge Hainey stated in the court document: The bank’s decision to freeze the exchange’s funds hasn’t affected the exchange much, as the decision affected less than 1% of the exchange’s customers. Gerald Cotten, Chief Executive Officer at QuadrigaCX, said in an email correspondence with a local news outlet, that the pace with which the matter is moving “pleased” him, and that he is optimistic that the matter will be resolved before the turn of the year. Cotten also added: This dispute comes as the latest in a wave of investigations of “unscrupulous cryptocurrency investments” by regulators across the United States and Canada this year. As part of “Operation Cryptosweep,” which was commenced by the North American Securities Administration Association (NASA), well over 70 investigations were opened back in May, and more have been coming since then.

        "passage": "From many perspectives, Bitcoin may seem to have no function in today’s economy. Yes, it can be spent. But as Samson Mow of Bitcoin development studio, Blockstream, has stated, the base layer of the BTC blockchain isn’t exactly ready to support the world’s demands of a global medium of exchange. Transactions can take upwards of twenty minutes, can cost more than $0.5, and are technically public and can be tied back to your identity without the proper payment solutions.  But, data is showing that Bitcoin is finding a real-world use case in countries where corruption is suspected to be quite high. And this — using Bitcoin to stave off overreaching governments — is really the use case that long-time cryptocurrency proponents believe was what Satoshi Nakamoto was going for when he brought Bitcoin into the world. Bitcoin is a global trend. People from all over the world, barring that they don’t have access to the Internet, can use the cryptocurrency and its respective blockchain without a financial cost or a know-your-customer procedure. If you want to use Bitcoin, all you have to do is download an app. Getting the coins themselves, however, is a bit of a different story. While anyone can mine BTC or access a wallet, exchanges where you can purchase the cryptocurrencies may require you to have a bank account and government identification. Although this is no problem for someone in a democratic country like the U.S., working with exchanges in some of the less-developed and corrupt areas of the world may prove to be an issue. In these states, not only may you not have an I.D. or bank account but using an exchange may be illegal or frowned upon. Enter Local Bitcoins, a platform that promotes the peer-to-peer exchange of Bitcoin and fiat currency in a manner that is less regulatory stringent than, say, Coinbase or Bitstamp. According to data published by a user on Twitter, there is a clear correlation between a country’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the share of GDP (a measure of an economy’s size) that Local Bitcoins volume makes up. The correlation: the more corruption there is in a country’s government, the bigger role Local Bitcoins (and thus cryptocurrency) takes in its economy. Venezuela, which sported a CPI of 18 (one of the lowest in the world) in 2018, has a Local Bitcoins market that made up 0.2326% of its 2018 GDP. Venezuela is followed by Nigeria, Russia, Colombia, Ukraine, Kenya, Peru, and South Africa — all nations with relatively low CPI’s, according to Transparency.org.  This correlation is accentuating that in places where corruption, financial turmoil, and political debacles are rampant, Bitcoin is finding bona fide use. Alright, so now that we can see that a country’s level of governmental corruption is tied to the usage of Local Bitcoins, what are the oppressed using Bitcoin for? Is BTC a capital hedge/store of value or an alternative currency free from control to them? Well, it’s often a mix of both. Venezuela is a perfect example of a place in which Bitcoin serves two, maybe even three, primary functions. In the South American country, there are strict capital controls and there is rampant hyperinflation. You can find stories online of Venezuelans converting their bolivars to cryptocurrency instantly to protect their wealth, to buy goods without oversight and in a devaluing currency, and to move money across borders without governmental oversight and restrictions. So while Bitcoin may not be ready for use in the U.S. as a medium of exchange, have no doubt that it is helping those being oppressed by governments the world over.",

        "passage": "Transoil International and Solaris Commodities are the latest companies to use blockchain for commodity trading. The two companies used blockchain to settle the trade of 25,000 metric tons of 11.5 percent protein Black Sea wheat that was shipped from the Russian port of Novorossiysk. S&P Global reported on November 12th that the two companies used a blockchain-based agri-commodities trading and financing platform that was built by Swiss firm Cerealia for the transaction. According to the same report, this is the first time that Black Sea wheat has been traded via blockchain. There is no word yet on how much the cargo was worth, or who settled the financial side of the transaction.  Like many companies in the global supply chain, Transoil and Solaris probably want to take advantage of the efficiencies that blockchain has the potential to create. The global commodities trade is archaic in many ways, and blockchain could be the technology that changes a business that has remained mostly static for centuries. By all accounts, the blockchain-based trading platform that Cerealia created worked well. S&P Global reproduced this statement from Cerealia in their report, “An independent auditor has reviewed all the important details of the trade from the blockchain and validated the smart contract, digital signatures, signed document and timestamps. (The auditor) also confirmed that data has been encrypted, that no other data has been stored and that all data is up to date.” Unlike the complex paper-based trade finance system that is still used in most nations today, blockchain provides instant access to all parties that are involved in a shipment. This can help to resolve disputes as they arise, and could simplify tracking throughout the shipping process. The world’s food logistics network is complex. Countries have the ability to connect across vast distances, but keeping track of cargoes can be difficult. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) developed their own blockchain-based tracking that integrates trade finance, which was tested earlier this year. CBA worked with an almond grower in Victoria, Australia, to ship almonds to Hamburg, Germany.  The shipping process involved numerous companies, all of which had real-time access to the location of the almonds as they moves across the planet. CBA integrated and Internet-of-Things (IoT) based tracking system into their blockchain-platform, which makes tracking chain-of-custody much easier. Walmart is another major company that is moving towards using blockchain on a daily basis. As one of the largest retailers of food in the USA, Walmart has to keep track of an enormous amount of product. Until now that has been difficult, which is why they are requiring all their leafy green vegetable suppliers to use an IBM-designed blockchain tracking platform. Instead of having to dive into a paper-based record keeping system that can literally take days to track down where lettuce came from, the new IBM blockchain platform does the same task in a few seconds. Not only that, but it also allows Walmart to locate any other stores that may have the same produce on sale. There are periodic outbreaks of food poisoning that could be mitigated by the system that Walmart is deploying, which means that leafy green vegetables could be the first of many kinds of food to go on the blockchain. Making the food distribution system safer and more efficient is a great thing from a business perspective, but saving lives makes blockchain adoption a no-brainer. Depending on how one wants to measure its age, blockchain is at most a decade old. Realistically the technology is much younger than that, which makes the speed at which it is entering the global marketplace extremely dramatic. With every new use case that shows the value that blockchain creates, the trust that it needs to create grows. The next few years will be very interesting for blockchain development, and the companies that adopt it early will probably be setting themselves up to take full advantage of an amazing technology that is coming into its own.",

Analysts at the Boston-based advisory firm the emerging asset class has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in the established digital world. Thus, big-money players stand the chance of gaining first-mover advantage by claiming significant positions on virtual currency investments.  According to Bloomberg, the firm issued a note to its clients on Monday (February 18, 20190 urging them to consider Bitcoin investment funds. Analysts at Cambridge Associates say crypto-focused investments could potentially reap huge rewards for institutional investors. The company says the risks associated with Bitcoin and other virtual currencies shouldn’t dissuade big-money players from putting up equity in the market. Throughout 2018, cryptocurrencies endured a prolonged bear market that caused prices to plummet by more than 80 percent. Commenting on the matter in the note to clients, Cambridge Associates analysts said: However, while cryptocurrency investments have the potential to produce massive returns, the firm says institutional investors shouldn’t jump in head first without carrying out due diligence. According to the analysts, pension funds, endowments, family offices, and other big-money players should obtain adequate information about the industry before deciding on which investments to make. While still in its infancy, the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, spawning different investment avenues. From spot trading on exchange platforms to futures contracts and even illiquid venture funds, there are numerous options for institutional investors. Already, some institutions have invested significantly in cryptocurrencies. In February 2019, Morgan Creek Digital announced that it had secured investments from two public pension funds based in Fairfax County, Virginia. These two funds are the first public pension plans to invest in cryptocurrencies. On Monday, Blockonomi reported that big-money investors make up the majority of the revenue inflow for Grayscale Investments, a virtual currency asset management firm. According to the company’s annual report, institutional investors contributed 66 percent of its inflows for the entire 2018. Stakeholders like Tom Lee say 2019 could be a watershed year for the emerging cryptocurrency landscape as a whole. These commentators say while there might not be a massive price rally, different projects are laying the groundwork for the establishment of the market on a more robust footing. However, if the wave of institutional investors that continues to be the clamor for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts is ever going to materialize, many commentators say the industry needs improved legitimacy. Thus, issues like price manipulation, ICO scams, and other fraudulent activities need to be eradicated or at least minimized. Robust custody tools and market manipulation continue to be prominent pain points for the market as a whole. In January, Fidelity Investments announced that it would launch its cryptocurrency custodial service in March 2019. Nasdaq also recently announced a partnership with Brave New Coin (BNC) to offer real-time price indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In a recent interview with Forbes, Alex Sunnarborg, managing partner at Tetras Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund management firm, says the launch of services like Fidelity and Bakkt will be pivotal to the status of the industry as a whole. The entry of such reputable mainstream players could introduce sweeping changes in the legitimacy of virtual currency market data.",

The global partnership agreement between People Capital and Xunlei was signed on July 22, 2018. It and was first disclosed at the China-US Entrepreneur and Investment Summit hosted by the People’s Daily Online in Silicon Valley, California.  Contained in the agreement signed by both parties is the plan to establish a laboratory for “technology innovation” and serving as a component of the People’s Capital Blockchain Research Institute. The collaboration of both entities will be geared towards exploring the application of blockchain technology to integrate its innovative system across different businesses. General Manager of the People’s Daily Ye Zhenzhen pointed to the “operating mechanism” as the most important part of the blockchain mechanism. He went further stating that “Through the ingenious combination of technologies, the fair distribution of resources is completed.” Poised to ensure blockchain is streamlined along with the services rendered by the People’s Daily Online which is the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CCP), the collaboration will also build a “high-level industrial service platform” to provide offline activities such as workshops, seminars, and application competitions.   Mr. Zhao Yahui, General Manager of People Capital and Mr. Lei Chen, Xunlei and Onething Technologies CEO, jointly announced the establishment of the blockchain foundational technology innovation laboratory. Image Source. Established in 1997, the People’s Daily Online is the online version of the People’s Daily, and it floats a multilingual internet presence with pages in Arabic, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and English. These pages provide news mainly about happenings in China but offer a less in-depth discourse on socio-political and economic analysis of China’s foreign policies and political trajectories. People’s Daily has often been regarded by many as the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party. The company enjoys the largesse of the government through tax allowances thereby giving it the leverage for expansion. The company was exempted from remitting taxes from 2010 to 2013 as part of concessions to ensure state-controlled cultural firms become real companies.  The online version in 2012 became modern China’s first listed media company on the country’s A-Share Market running an editorial business. Xunlei, a multinational technology company, and an online service provider, is one of the global leaders in the provision of blockchain infrastructures and services for companies in China and beyond. Founded in 2003, the company ranked as the most commonly used BitTorrent client in the world in 2010. Its peer-to-peer software and download manager supports HTTP, FTP, eDonkey and BitTorrent protocols. Last month, China’s oldest media publication covering news in the tech industry, Beijing Sci-Tech made known its plans to offer subscriptions payable with Bitcoin (BTC). The development was received with mixed reactions due to the government’s recent clampdown on crypto exchanges and Initial Coin Offerings which halted blockchain operations among many operators. Back in July, an audacious project worth $5 million was sponsored by blockchain platform ConsenSys to provide blockchain startup Civil Media Company with a platform where independent newsrooms can keep correspondence with their readers. These readers will have the privilege of possessing stakes in the form of cryptocurrency to support any publication they trust on the blockchain. The effort which is an innovation aimed at integrating journalism into the blockchain will give readers the right to vote for stories they deem ethical with their civil tokens. Civil launched its token (CVL) on September 28 in a fundraising event. The company promised not to relent on its oars until it creates a decentralized network for ethical journalism. 681 of its newsreaders have purchased their CVL token, and this amounted to $1,344,721.59.

According to reports from Russian radio news station Govorit Moskva, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets announced that the Russian government will likely press forward with a national cryptocurrency. Anatoly Aksakov told a press conference that the Duma is working on a plan for a Russian cryptocurrency, “but it will be a ruble-pegged cryptocurrency.” Instead of creating a new currency that would compete directly with other cryptos, the ‘Crypto Ruble’ would be pegged at 1:1 to the fiat ruble.  This announcement marks the first movement from a major government on the topic of a national crypto, which could be used by the general public. It could also be part of a bigger banking shift in Russia. For now, the Crypto Ruble is still just an idea, but it seems like more progress is being made by Russian lawmakers all the time. The plan that chairman Anatoly Aksakov described appears to be in line with other stablecoins like Tether. Unlike a private stablecoin that relies on a bank account filled with fiat currency, the Russian plan seems to be a little bit different. An individual would be able to open a normal ruble account, and then have them ‘turned into’ Crypto Rubles. The exact mechanism was not discussed at the press conference, but the Crypto Ruble would likely be based in blockchain. While this state-basked stablecoin probably not what crypto purists were hoping for, national stablecoins could spread the use of cryptos among people that aren’t comfortable with using cryptos like bitcoin.  Read: National Cryptocurrencies: Russian Cryptoruble, Venezuelan Petro and Estonian Estcoin In addition to being backed by a fiat currency, the Crypto Ruble would probably be accepted by other nations that have friendly relationships with Russia. At the moment there are numerous shifts happening in the Eurasian political environment, and this new program could be a part of a wider strategy from Moscow. The Venezuelan Petro is pretty much a joke, as no one in their right mind wants anything to do with Venezuela or its currency. Russia has been the target of sanctions that originate in the USA, but they have an economy that supplies a tremendous amount of fossil fuels to both Europe and China. The Crypto Ruble probably wouldn’t be put into the same class as the Petro, as Russia does business with some of the largest economies on earth. Russia also has a number of currency swap agreements with numerous trading partners, which would make establishing ruble accounts simple. Once a foreign currency has been swapped for rubles, it seems that Crypto Rubles would be a logical next step for trading partners who were willing to deal in them. Russia has been far more resilient to the US-led sanctions that many thought possible. As part of the sanctions, Russia was cut off from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers. Instead of bow to international pressure, Russia designed their own international money transfer platform. Chairman Aksakov told reporters that “Our domestic system (called SPFS) for the transfer of financial messages already has more users that SWIFT has. Talks with China, Iran, Turkey and a number of other countries are currently underway in order to coordinate our system with their systems. It is important to coordinate them technologically in order to avoid problems with domestic systems for transfer of financial messages,” at a press conference in Moscow last Thursday. A national cryptocurrency would make international transfers even easier for Russia to facilitate. The USA has been in a position of financial power for many decades, but now it looks like realistic alternatives to the established system are nearing readiness. The Crypto Ruble could be a big part of a new global payments system and would give Russia an advantage if their relationship with the USA continues to worsen.",

        "passage": "Popular encrypted messaging app Telegram is reportedly on the verge of publicly unveiling its planned cryptocurrency token, the Gram. According to a trio of Telegram investors who have spoken with The New York Times, the instant messenger company is aiming to release the first waves of Gram tokens by the end of October. The claims come after Telegram founder Pavel Durov said back in January that the TON network, the blockchain designed to underpin the Gram currency, was approximately 90 percent completed development-wise at the time.  Telegram had first announced its initial coin offering (ICO) for the project in January 2018. Within a few months, the social network had raised nearly $2 billion USD to build out the so-called Telegram Open Network. It was the second largest ICO in the space to date behind the EOS offering, which raised $4.2 billion during its run. According to a separate report from Russian media outlet Vedomosti, another investor said Telegram intends to open up public tests of Ton as of September 1st. The messenger powerhouse, which boasts more than 200 million users, envisions making the Gram the currency of choice within its own ecosystem. The company’s flagship app is already a mainstay among cryptocurrency communities of all sizes, and the ability to easily send digital currency within that app like a text message is likely to catch on with many users if everything proceeds according to plan. Of course, Telegram will have to continue navigating the regulatory implications of its new would-be global currency, like social media giant Facebook is currently facing with its proposed Libra stablecoin. Facebook has received a wave of regulatory attention over the project, and some think Telegram could be in store for a similar treatment. “I suspect that regulators will take a very close look at this offering,” cryptocurrency lawyer Richard Levin told NYT. One way or another, it looks like the TON network and its native Gram currency are getting closer to arrival. That mean these projects’ communities will have plenty of catching up to do when it comes to positioning themselves within the cryptoeconomy. The good news for them is some efforts are already being made on that front. For example, the decentralized exchange GramEth was presented as an ETHBerlin Hackathon project last week. As the builders of the DEX explained, it’s the “first-ever exchange that will allow making atomic swaps between TON and ETH.” If the project continues to be built out, then TON users will have another viable way to exchange their Gram tokens for ether and vice versa in the TON network’s fledgling days. Cosmos, Algorand, TON, and Filecoin. These are a few of the big-name “Layer 1” projects that are entering, or are angling toward, their adolescence. But in being new projects built in new ways, they are going to face novel challenges that earlier projects like Bitcoin didn’t have to endure. So explained Arianna Simpson, founder of venture capital firm Autonomous Partners, in a notable Twitter thread this week.  When Bitcoin first launched there were no incentives to attack it because it was essentially unknown, Simpson noted. But the opposite is true for larger cryptocurrency projects launching in 2019 and beyond. “There are 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars to be made by attacking top chains, and that # is rising,” she wrote.  Of course, these new projects’ builders are aware they’re launching into adversarial environments and are taking various precautions accordingly. But Simpson’s point is that the attack surfaces are way larger now, and malicious actors have more financial incentives to take advantage of those larger surfaces.",

The company is making efforts to comply with the SEC and approval would mean that the Blockstack could sell its Stacks (STX) tokens. Additionally, a nod from the regulatory body would stand the company’s token out as the first ever SEC- qualified token offering.  Blockstack PBC, a blockchain computing network headquartered in New York, announced on Thursday, April 11, that its subsidiary, Blockstack Token LLC, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $50 million in token sales. According to the company’s blog, the token offering would use SEC’s Regulation A+ framework. The Regulatory A+ framework, which serves as an alternative to the traditional IPO, is an updated version of the Regulation A. The updated version also offers an exemption for smaller companies that wish to offer and sell securities. With the Regulatory A+ comes two tiers, Tier 1 and Tier 2, with the former offering $20 million and the latter offering $50 million, both over a 12-month period. Blockstack filed an offering statement with the SEC using Tier 2. According to the filing submitted on Thursday, the company would offer 295 million Stack Tokens. The breakdown included 215 million tokens for $0.12 each and 40 million tokens for $0.30 each. Blockstack plans to offer the remaining 40 million Stack Tokens for “non-cash consideration” in line with its “App Mining Program” which would be used to develop standard applications on the company’s platform. With approval from the SEC, Blockstack’s token sale would be the first ever SEC-qualified token offering. The recent move by the company would set the pace for other players in the sector and would usher in regulated tokens. The release further noted that the company was creating a framework in strict compliance with the SEC guidelines. Speaking further on the matter, Co-founder and CEO of Blockstack PBC, Dr. Muneeb Ali said: Muneeb further stated that the towing the regulatory line was a conscious decision, with the knowledge that would be time-consuming and require plenty of work. The SEC has constantly referred to most token offerings as “securities”, with the cryptocurrency projects referring to their tokens as “utility” instead. In 2017, SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton stated that tokens and offerings marketed with the aim of getting profit, fall under the U.S. Security Law. In April 2019, the commission released a guidance framework that tried to clearly define the categorization of token offerings. The Blockstack filing further revealed that Harvard University is also investing in the company’s million-dollar token offering. The university’s endowment along with two other investors are participating in the company’s token sale. An excerpt from the filing reads: The remaining four are independent members, which include Koen Langendoen, Arvind Narayanan, Arianna Simpson, and Catherine Tucker. Morgan Creek’s Anthony Pompliano took to his Twitter handle to tweet the university’s involvement.  Back in 2018, another Ivy League School, Yale University, also dabbled into the virtual currency market. The university invested in a digital currency fund called Paradigm, that raised $400 million. Even with concerns bordering from lack of regulation to money laundering, the involvement of different institutions in the cryptocurrency market shows the continuous expansion of the industry. With the educational sector gradually warming up to virtual currency, adoption is set for an all-time high.",

        "passage": "Whilst Spanish regulators have made their viewpoints on more stringent cryptocurrency and blockchain assets regulation somewhat clear-cut, this hasn’t stopped a major Spanish bank from announcing that they will be using the technology to facilitate a green bond issuance. The financial institution in question – Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), are Spain’s second largest bank.  As per the BBVA official website, the news confirms that structured green bonds will be supported by the blockchain protocol. The announcement indicates that the structure will be in collaboration with Mapfre, a Spanish insurance company. The aforementioned firm will be investing 35 million EUR in to the project, which has the overarching aim of facilitating financial products whilst remaining sustainable. The press release itself states that BBVA “issued the first structured green bond using blockchain technology to negotiate the terms and conditions,” For those unaware, a green bond operates in a similar way to traditional investment bonds, although there are some clear differences. First and foremost, as the name suggests, a green bond is linked specifically to investment projects that center on sustainable projects. This can include a range of green initiates such as pollution prevention, sustainable forestry and fishery, water management, clean transportation and eco-technologies. Not only this, but due to the nature of the underlying projects linked to green bonds, governments often give financial institutions certain tax benefits, and in some cases, outright tax exemption. In fact, according to rating agency Moody’s, global investment in green bonds surpassed $93 billion in 2016, further illustrating investor appetite for financial products that aim to make a difference. When it comes to the deal struck by BBVA and Mapfre, the 35 million EUR that was invested will be based on a 6 year term, with the underlying currency rate based on a 5 year Euro swap rate. According to the Chief Investment Officer at Mapfre – José Luis Jiménez: The CIO continued by adding that the project is potentially the first of many, with other sustainable investment-based products possibly on the way. On the other hand, this isn’t the first time that BBVA have involved themselves in blockchain technology. For example, in November 2018, it was reported that BBVA bank would be utilizing their blockchain network to facilitate a 150 million EUR loan. The deal, which was also in collaboration with major financial institutions BNP Paribas of France and MUFG of Japan, would be loaned to Red Electrica Corporation. The loan arrangement was fully supported by blockchain technology throughout the end-to-end process, with data represented on a secure ledger built on top of the Ethereum protocol. Prior to this, April 2018 saw BBVA bank close a 75 million EUR loan arrangement using distributed ledger technology. Ultimately, the usage of blockchain technology to facilitate inter-bank financial transactions has long been discussed as a potential solution to the current status quo. At present, the process of issuing corporate loans is a long, complex and highly inefficient process which requires a significant number of manual interactions. Not only this, but traditional methods of performing high-value corporate loans are hugely costly. On the contrary, blockchain technology allows financial institutions to initiate fast, low-cost and efficient transactions, with the framework often noted for its immutable characteristics.",

        "passage": "Libra has undoubtedly become the talk of the town over recent weeks. Since being unveiled just one month ago, the cryptocurrency has been mentioned by giants in technology, finance, and politics — Donald Trump included. On Tuesday, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon hopped on the Libra bandwagon, actually taking some time to bash the project while lauding his own take on digital assets — the privatized JPM Coin.  Libra has been expected by some analysts, including legendary Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos, to usurp traditional banks. In fact, in a recent video published to his Youtube channel, Antonopoulos claimed that retail banks should be scared of what the Facebook-backed cryptocurrency will bring to the table. While he isn’t a fan of the relative centralized nature of Libra in comparison to, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Greek-British coder explains that by virtue of Facebook having billions of clients, banks’ hegemony will be lost. This could mean that if Wall Street’s biggest names don’t launch similar projects or put pressure on Libra, their profits will falter, as will the value of their stock. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan isn’t fazed, however. Far from. Speaking to analysts in a conference call that has been cited by CNBC, the banking mogul noted that he does not feel threatened by Libra at all. He specifically looks to the fact that blockchain has been a technological trend for “seven years” and that “very little has happened”, presumably proposing that Libra will be more of a marketing ploy than a viable technology. “We’re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn’t spend too much time on it”, Dimon added. What’s more, Dimon made it clear that any new sorties into the financial services industry, be it Libra from Facebook & Co. or Bitcoin, will require proper regulatory approval, especially after the financial crisis and 9/11. He stated: While Dimon is totally cool with Libra, for now anyway, politicians on The Hill and across governments the world over seem to be running scared. On Tuesday and Wednesday, different committees in Washington, D.C. hosted Facebook’s head of Calibra/Blockchain David Marcus and experts in finance and cryptocurrency alike to talk about the potential effects of Libra. On Wednesday, the sole House Representative of Guam, San Nicolas, asserted that Libra could be a massive systemic risk in the United States. He simply proved his point by noting that even if a portion of Facebook’s over two billion active users had $100 worth of Libra in their wallets, outflows of the U.S. dollars (and other fiat currencies and government securities for that matter) would be massive, potentially posing a threat to the stability of the economy. California’s Brad Sherman, a staunch Bitcoin critic that recently called on Congress to “ban all cryptocurrency”, likened Libra to innovation that may be as bad as Bin Laden’s 9/11. Sherman is fearful that Libra could be used for terrorist financing and other illicit activities, just as the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Donald Trump mentioned in their respective comments on the recent resurgence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Congress has yet to take any clear action, presumably because they can’t really, but Representatives and Maxine Waters have continued to call for a moratorium on Libra’s development. Marcus has only “committed” to making sure “everything is right” before the launch of Libra, neither giving a yes or no to Waters’ inquiries.",

CoinCola already allows their clients to trade fiat currency for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, USDT and Dash, so  XRP will make a welcome addition to an already robust set of options. Over The Counter (OTC) trading offers substantial benefits for CoinCola’s customers, and many large institutions use the same framework due to its efficiency and speed. Instead of dealing with a market-maker, traders and investors are able to trade directly and save money on trading fees.  CoinCola has been an active player in crypto trading and has created a platform that helps to keep trading costs low. The addition of XRP to their line-up of cryptos only adds to an already robust offering of trading options. This year has been rough for the reputation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Last year saw billions raised with ICOs, but today many are known to be outright scams. CoinCola offers its users the safety of escrow for their trades and purchases, so they get the assets they are paying for. CoinCola offers its clients the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, USDT, Dash and Ripple. Their platform also allows the direct purchase of cryptos with their local fiat currency. Regardless of whether a clients goal is a short-term trade or investment, CoinCola’s mobile-app enabled platform is worth considering. XRP started off 2018 with a bang. As the year progressed, XRP was neck and neck with ETH as the second largest crypto by total market value . Over the last month, it overtook ETH on a sustained basis, and today is second only to BTC in terms of market cap. Unlike other cryptos, which weren’t designed with a specific market in mind, Ripple was developed to make international transactions a breeze. The company has been successful in cementing agreements with major banks, including some of Japan’s largest banks. The Chief Market Strategist at Ripple, Cory Johnson, recently told the Techonomy 2018 conference that, The fact that a ‘crypto company’ has attracted so many paying clients is probably a plus for their long-term survivability, and CoinCola has recognized how important XRP could be going forward. One of the reasons why institutional investors prefer to use OTC markets is their lower fee structure. Because the exchange is only ensuring that both parties are on the up-and-up, the fees for an OTC transaction tend to be far lower than an on-exchange purchase.  CoinCola’s OTC exchange certainly delivers price-efficiency and allows crypto users of all sizes to take advantage of an OTC trading architecture. CoinCola offers free deposits for their customers. For people that want to use as market-maker , CoinCola offers trading pair as well. XRP will be the newest coin to join the list of majors already available at CoinCola, so traders have the ability to access the second-most valuable crypto issuance in the world.",

        "passage": "The syndicated loan market is demonstrating how quickly blockchain is going mainstream. BBVA just closed a $150 million USD syndicated loan for Electrica, the operator of the Spanish national power grid. Partner banks MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France were in on the syndicated loan, and both Linklaters and Herbert Smith Freehills had access to the blockchain platform that made the loan possible. Syndicated loans are a seemingly complex process, but they are made more cumbersome by the kinds of communications that are used by the involved parties. Instead of using the internet, syndicated loans are often settled via fax machines. You know, like from in the movies made a few decades ago.  The banking industry isn’t famous for innovation, but it looks like blockchain is creeping into a market that is worth literally trillions of US dollars. The blockchain platform that BBVA used for the syndicated loan was able to allow all the parties to simultaneously access the same database, make changes that were time stamped, and were unable to be altered. In many ways, this is a perfect system for settling syndicated loans, and it could be the beginning of much bigger things for blockchain. Prior to this pilot program, a syndicated loan could take weeks to finalize. There are complex arrangements to make, but a lot of that time was spent communicating, and recording data. This new platform cut the time down to a few days, which has some major implications for the banking industry. According to Ricardo Laiseca, who is BBVA’s head of global finance, blockchain will create, “huge reduction in internal costs,” for banks’ clients. He told the Financial Times that, “We are offering these technologies for collaboration with any other banks . . . This is not just for BBVA, we feel that as a second stage (we are) working on a new markets infrastructure which will be good for everyone,” and that at least five more blockchain settled syndicated loans are in his bank’s pipeline. Syndicated loans aren’t a new idea, and the fact they are still being finalized with outdated technology shows how reticent the banking industry is to innovation. The platform the BBVA and their partners used for the Electrica loan used the Ethereum blockchain, but there are other platforms out there as well. Finastra and NatWest are developing a Corda-based blockchain platform that has been developed specifically for syndicated loans, and it is due to go live on November 17 of this year. With the enormous amount of cost savings, it isn’t hard to see why banks are being forced to go blockchain, whether or not they want to. These platforms could also play a role in the emerging blockchain-based trade finance platforms, which are being deployed in Asia. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) just took their blockchain-based trade finance platform live, and is working with some of the largest banks in Asia to drastically change how trade finance happens. The platform was designed by Chinese insurance giant Ping-An, and was deployed into mainland China before being adopted in Hong Kong. In addition to cutting down the costs involved with trade finance, the new system helps banks to avoid some of the pitfalls associated with commercial lending. The participating banks will have access to other similar financing transactions on the platform, so they can see if they are being quoted costs that are out of line with industry norms. It should be clear by now that not only is blockchain here to stay, but it will probably also become a technology that is required to use in the near-term. When the time and costs involved in facilitating trillions of dollars worth of transactions are slashed by a huge amount, it is only a matter of time until competitiveness forces industry to shift to the more efficient technology.",

        "passage": "Another Bitcoin-based blackmail attempt has been discovered and was reported by ABC7 News in San Francisco last week. The potential victim received a letter in the mail demanding bitcoin in exchange for silence on alleged improprieties. But according to the receiver of the letter, he has nothing to worry about since the threat is obviously fake.  San Francisco resident Daniel Levinson received a letter in the mail claiming to be from a professional hacker calling themselves “BlackDoor-82”. The hacker claimed to have sensitive information that Levinson would not want his wife to know about. The hacker then claimed that this information came about through a job in San Francisco that then went into some deeper digging and eventually revealed what the hacker claims are the potential victim’s “misadventures”. In exchange for what the BlackDoor-82 calls a “confidentiality fee” of $8150, they claim they will not reveal the information they supposedly have. This fee must be paid in bitcoin. Interestingly enough, ABC7 News reported that the blackmail letter included a 19-step instruction guide for how to buy and send the cryptocurrency. Speaking to ABC7 News, Levinson said that he knew immediately that the letter was fake. After spending some time thinking, Levinson realized that there was nothing in his life that he would not want his wife to know about. The way the letter was phrased seemed intentionally vague. It does not claim that Levinson did anything specific, such as having an affair, a secret drinking problem, a gambling problem, or anything else. If the threat letter was real, it would likely include very specific details about true events in order to convince the potential victim that the threat was serious. Levinson’s wife Nora said that she found the letter “disturbing but also funny,” and that she had no concerns or doubts about her husband and his behavior in the past. This event is far from the first time that a would-be blackmailer demand payment through cryptocurrency. Blackmail letters of this type have been appearing for some years now. In 2016, writer Dave Eargle wrote of an event where he received a similar blackmail letter demanding bitcoin payment in exchange for silence. In Eargle’s case, the demand was for $2000 in Bitcoin. Eargle did his own research and found that the letter he received was very similar to one that was allegedly tied to the Ashley Madison hack. That letter, which was shared by GrahamCluley.com, a computer security news site, was sent out to an unknown number of people at random and also demanded $2000 in Bitcoin. Those blackmail letters went out in mid-to-late 2015, which is when the hack was a hot topic.  What’s also interesting to note is that while many of these blackmail letters were spread via email, this recent set of attacks has been done through the Postal Service on printed letters. This was perhaps done as a way to make the threat appear more realistic or terrifying. While emails can be mass fired off to an infinite number of addresses at random, sending physically printed letters in the mail requires quite a bit more care and attention, as well as cost for the much higher Postal Service fees. As a result, however, the blackmail letter not only shows more care and attention went into making the threat, but also that the person making the threat allegedly has the potential victim’s home address. As cryptocurrencies provide for an easy way to send large sums of money anonymously, these sorts of threats and scams will likely continue into the foreseeable future. This is especially true as more and more people become familiar with cryptocurrencies, and become more likely to have them on hand. In the early days of the Internet and even to a lesser extent the past few years, email fraud such as the infamous advance fee fraud or 419 scam cost victims millions of dollars. Perhaps cryptocurrency-fueled blackmail or other forms of fraud will be the next wave of attack that individuals will need to protect themselves from. Luckily, all it takes to remain safe is to simply not fall for the lies. It goes without saying, but if you yourself receive such a blackmail letter, you should report it to the police or other relevant authorities as soon as possible.",

        "passage": "Many in the crypto community were shocked in June when Facebook unveiled the firms backing Libra — Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Coinbase, Xapo, and countless other pro-innovation companies and investors. While the marketing material — which showed the Libra emblem enclosed by the logos of the aforementioned companies — made it seem like these partners are concretely part of Libra, there have been some doubts thrown around.  An executive of PayPal, who is effectively investing in a competitor by getting involved with Libra, recently came out to issue comments about the project, marking somewhat of a blow to the project amid already intense times for Libra. According to a report from the AFP published this weekend, PayPal isn’t 100% convinced Libra will become the money of the future. The fintech giant’s investor relations vice president, Gabrielle Rabinovitch, asserted that should PayPal reconsider, their involvement in the Libra Association is technically a “non-binding commitment”. Indeed, as reported by this outlet previously, the CEO of Visa said that what his firm signed with Libra is a “non-binding letter of intent”, meaning that “no one has yet officially joined”. Even the head of Facebook’s blockchain ambitions, PayPal alumnus David Marcus, has admitted that Libra partners reserve the right to pull their support. Rabinovitch, notably, didn’t even hint that PayPal is looking to make a dash for the door. But, she asserted that there is “a lot of work” that needs to be completed before Libra is anything more than “just a very exciting idea”. PayPal isn’t the only Libra Association member to have cast some doubt on the cryptocurrency. Previously, the Financial Times reported that three of the Libra Association’s members have been considering leaving the consortium. One of the executives of the skeptical firms said that Libra will put a strain on partners looking to maintain regulatory compliance. Some firms might want out, but others want in, specifically firms native to the crypto industry. The most notable of these Libra-curious firms is Gemini, the firm founded by Zuckerberg’s rivals, the Winklevoss Twins. The brothers said in a CNN interview that they have an active line with Libra’s team, but are currently waiting on more information about the project before pulling the trigger. Crypto infrastructure provider Bitcoin.com, previously led by Roger Ver, has also hinted at its interest in Libra. In a recent video published to the Bitcoin.com Youtube channel, Roger Ver said that his company has been in contact with Libra. There has been also of some involvement in Libra by Asian-centric cryptocurrency firms, namely Japanese exchange CoinCheck and Taiwanese exchange MaiCoin. Binance earlier this year said that it was also interested. However, the firm did a recent 180°, launching its own stablecoin project — the also-astrologically named Venus — to compete with Libra. All this comes at a very interesting turning point in Libra’s short but widely-covered lifespan. Last week, regulators in both France and Germany formally revealed moves to ban the development and launch of Libra in the European Union, echoing the line of U.S. politician Maxine Waters across the pond. On Monday, representatives from the world’s central banks met in Switzerland to meet with Libra, presumably to discuss the potential monetary and criminal risks involved in the revolutionary cryptocurrency project. Despite all this volatility internally and externally, key members in the whole Libra equation have still expressed their optimism. In recent interviews and event appearances, both the chief operating officer of Calibra",

        "passage": "The crypto market may be depressed, but the underlying industry is as dynamic as ever. Reports indicate that as Twitch, an Amazon-owned video streaming service, silently removed users’ ability to make subscriptions with Bitcoin, a legendary player in the online privacy space opened its arms to accept an array of digital assets.  Not 48 hours ago, Redditors on the BTC forum claimed that Twitch removed support for payments made through BitPay, purported the crypto industry’s longest standing firm. While it isn’t clear when the content sharing platform added the feature, the forum-goer that drew attention to this issue claimed that Twitch removed BitPay support “in the last couple of weeks for all countries.” From Blockonomi’s glance of the Twitch subscription portal, BitPay is not a listed payment option, nor is Coinbase or direct Bitcoin payments, which the company claimed to have added at the peak of the previous rally. While this recent change flew under the radar, one user with the moniker “1John8Lare” took drastic action. The Twitch viewer “took action” by canceling all his subscriptions, slightly hurting streamers’ revenue, and sending Twitch’s support staff a ticket. It isn’t clear if other vigilantes took John’s lead, but it seems that many cryptocurrency users expressed disdain towards such a move, deemed an attempt to demonetize and deplatform content creators by some conspiracists. In stark contrast to the centralized Twitch, Tor, the de-facto go-to privacy- and anonymity-centric browser provider, has unveiled a donation jar that accepts cryptocurrencies. Tor’s website now accepts payments in nine leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, Monero, ZCash, and Augur. Interestingly though, users may contact Tor’s staffers if they intend to donate other digital assets that aren’t listed. The page purportedly encourages crypto philanthropists, many of which frequent the open-source Tor Browser and what it gives access to, to stand up for “universal rights to privacy and freedom” by keeping Tor’s products up-to-date. Sure, Twitch’s sudden removal of support for digital asset payments is a slight blow to the ecosystem, but arguably, adoption is booming. Just last week, Avnet, one of the world’s most prominent electronic components distributor, revealed it had integrated a payment portal from the Atlanta-based BitPay. In an announcement, the American technology company, a part of the Fortune 500, revealed that it would be accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash for its offerings. Avnet’s team sees cryptocurrencies as a step above traditional rails, as a company release argued that such assets can reduce the “time, cost and complexities of bringing products to market.” This is, of course, far from Apple, let’s say, accepting Bitcoin. But the move has been appreciated by the crypto community nonetheless. But, such acceptance may be just on the horizon. Two weeks back, Blockonomi reported that The Block’s sources have revealed that Starbucks is assumably on the verge of accepting Bitcoin payments through Bakkt’s infrastructure. The insiders tell the outlet that the world-renowned coffee roastery’s “mutually beneficial” partnership with Bakkt stipulates that it will accept the leading cryptocurrency within the next 12 to 18 months. Considering the legitimacy of The Block’s source, a food chain with thousands of locations across the globe may be on the verge of delving into Bitcoin. And with Square doubling down on its involvement in this space, with its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, unveiling a crypto-only branch that will hire five, many are sure that cryptocurrencies are far from dead in the water. But the pressing question remains: how fast will widespread adoption really occur?",

        "passage": "This week, Nasdaq, the company that runs the world’s second-largest stock market, announced a dissemination relationship with Brave New Coin that will see two cryptocurrency indices added to the sprawling Nasdaq Global Index Data ServiceSM, or GIDS, the company’s “premier real-time datafeed,” on February 25th, 2019. The indices, the Bitcoin Liquid Index and the Ethereum Liquid Index, will allow traders and institutions to track the prices of bitcoin and ether in order to make it easier to “evaluate investments and track portfolios.”  “The Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) are each designed to provide a real-time spot or reference rate for the price of 1 BTC and 1 ETH respectively, quoted in USD, and based on the most liquid ends of their markets,” the Nasdaq team said in the relationship announcement. The BLX and ELX, which will both have spot-rate frequency intervals of 30 seconds, will join tens of thousands of other mainstream indices on GIDS, which monitors 20 different index series covering global equities, commodities, and beyond. In this light, the price valuations of two of the cryptoeconomy’s top assets have taken another tangible step forward toward mainstream significance. Nasdaq Inc., which presently bears a market capitalization above $10 trillion USD, has been making increased overtures toward the cryptocurrency space in recent months. In January, Forbes reporter Michael del Castillo revealed the company at that point had seen seven cryptocurrency exchanges start using its enterprise-grade surveillance tech product after the exchanges had successfully passed a “due diligence process.” Brave New Coin, a cryptocurrency-centric data research company with offices in Auckland, London, Melbourne, and New York, also offers BNC Custom Indices, which can be used to track tailored cryptocurrency pairs in regions around the world. In Nov. 2017, just as the cryptoeconomy’s last bull run was kicking into high gear, Nasdaq started working toward a bitcoin futures product for its Nasdaq Futures (NFX) exchange and had “briefed market participants on its plans,” per WSJ. Since then, the company has been mum on a release date for the offering. The crypto pivot suggested that the stock exchange operators, whose platform is currently bested in trade volume among all the world’s exchanges only by the New York Stock Exchange, thought it could make a superior offering compared to America’s inaugural bitcoin futures products greenlighted for CME Group and CBOE Global Markets Inc. in Dec. 2017. Likewise, in Dec. 2018, Nasdaq Ventures invested in the Series B fundraising round of ErisX, a forthcoming cryptocurrency derivatives platform that wants to take crypto contracts into the heart of Wall Street. It was an operational bet that the market for such derivatives has plenty of room to grow. Moreover, it was only last spring that Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq Inc., said the company’s leadership was open to the possibility of shifting into a cryptocurrency exchange in the future. “Certainly, Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time,” Friedman said. But it’s not all about just crypto for the company. Last summer, Nasdaq and a group of financial services enterprises collaborated with Dutch bank ABN AMRO on a blockchain-centric proof of concept designed to efficiently process margin calls in securities markets. “We believe that blockchain technology brings with it a huge potential to transform markets everywhere, and this project is an excellent showcase of this,” Nasdaq Clearing CEO Julia Haglind said of the project. Taken altogether, these various developments clearly indicate that Nasdaq’s wider forays into the cryptocurrency ecosystem may only be just beginning.",

        "passage": "The public may now be closer to identifying the culprits behind the Coincheck hack, the largest the cryptoeconomy has experienced to date. Coincheck, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange based in Tokyo, saw its NEM (XEM) hot wallet scraped by hackers last January. The attackers netted 520 million coins, which were then worth approximately $530 million USD. As such, the economic impact was larger than the fallout caused by the 2014 Mt. Gox hack, which cost that exchange’s traders upwards of $400 million.  In the wake of the XEM heist, Coincheck committed to compensating affected traders to the tune of $0.81 per every XEM lost with the exchange’s own revenues. After the hack, speculation mounted that North Korean hackers were the culprits. Cybersecurity firms have found the country’s notorious hacker , Lazarus APT, did indeed steal billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2018. And Japan’s National Intelligence Service did initiate a probe last year as to whether Lazarus hackers led the Coincheck hack. Yet a new report suggests Russian hackers, not North Korean hackers, may have been involved in the episode. That report, published Monday by esteemed Osaka-based outlet Asahi Shimbun, revealed that computer viruses with definitive Russian origins had been discovered on the company computers of Coincheck employees. Those viruses were Netwire and Mokes. Netwire is a trojan style malware, designed to discreetly penetrate users’ devices for the purposes of keylogging, collecting information, establishing remote access, and more. Similarly, Mokes is malware that’s been specialized to steal valuable information like passwords via backdoor techniques. Cybersecurity experts consider both viruses to have been created in Russia. Notably, they are the types of malware that could have been used to compromise Coincheck’s internal system ahead of the exchange’s XEM hot wallet hack. Of course, the presence of Netwire and Mokes on Coincheck computers doesn’t mean a direct forensic trail has yet been established to the hackers. Rather, the development has revealed new circumstantial evidence, i.e. that tools originating from Russia and that Russian or Eastern European hackers would’ve presumably been comfortable using have turned up at the scene of the crime. It’s not beyond hackers to use tools that would superficially incriminate others, and it’s worth noting that Netwire and Mokes may have been used precisely for that reason: to throw off investigators from discovering the true perpetrators. So it’s still theoretically possible that North Koreans were behind the Coincheck hack. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has previously identified a wing within the increasingly advanced Lazarus Group they dubbed Bluenoroff. Kaspersky’s experts have said Bluenoroff specializes in financial attacks, meaning the team would have the technical skills to 1) lead a devastating attack on Coincheck and 2) obfuscate their attack’s origins. Yet the appareance of Netwire and Mokes in Coincheck’s infrastructure has others thinking otherwise. One cybersecurity expert who spoke to Asahi Shimbun said the viruses did indicate that Russian speakers could have been invovled. Whatever investigators end up determining was the case, it appears the Coincheck hackers had more than just a passing knowledge of cryptocurrency tech. That’s because the hackers seemed to have been aware that the NEM blockchain used the Proof of Importance (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI incentivizes node runners to hold large amounts of XEM, and it seems the hackers realized Coincheck’s XEM hot wallet was a low hanging fruit, as XEM was the only cryptocurrency the exchange wasn’t storing safely in cold storage accordingly. On a related and curious note, the Coincheck hack may have been the largest to date in the cryptoeconomy’s fledgling history, but the attackers didn’t make off with any money. The NEM Foundation somewhat controversially blacklisted the wallet the stolen XEM were sent to, which effectively condemned the coins to oblivion.",

        "passage": "Excessive volatility is probably one of the main obstacles standing in the way between cryptocurrencies and mass adoption, however, new hope emerges in the market of digital assets as bitcoin (BTC) recorded the lowest volatility rate by far, indicating that the cryptocurrency might be slowly acquiring increased stability in oppose to previous market trends. According to Dow Jones Market Data on bitcoin’s volatility, the top traded cryptocurrency showed the least volatile trading range by far, opposing high volatility levels as previously seen, especially during major dips in the market back in November 2018.  Bitcoin reached 7.8 percent in volatility, which is a rather narrow trading range, even more so when compared to the previous lowest volatility score that ranged to 21.2 percent, as recorded back at the beginning of 2017. The average volatility rate in the period from October 2013 to October 2018 is set at 53.7 percent, which makes the progress even more obvious. As bitcoin has set another record, this time positive, analysts and people from the industry consider that the case of bitcoin reaching the lowest volatility by far may be a sign of positive changes as well.  Even though cryptocurrency sceptics such as Nouriel Roubini, an economist who had debated on the fact that excessive volatility which included 100 percent trading ranges as seen back in 2017, believe that bitcoin and digital assets based on the same underlying technology have multiple shortcomings described in Roubini’s Testimony. The CEO of a UK-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, Danny Scott, believes that declining volatility should have positive effects on the general interest in cryptocurrency. Opinions are divided however, Roubini remains firm about his views on the cryptocurrency market in the testimony for a Senate hearing that took place in October. The testimony is called “Exploring the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain System” and it clearly pushes a negative momentum for cryptocurrency market as Roubini writes that “Crypto is the Mother of All Scams and (Now Busted) Bubbles While Blockchain Is the Most Over-Hyped Technology Ever, No Better than a Spreadsheet/Database” in form of a subtitle for his testimony. Roubini further describes bitcoin as a poor store of value due to the high volatility levels that often reach up to 30 percent in a single day, which in Roubini’s opinion represents one of the main reasons why bitcoin adoption is poor among merchants alongside the lack of stability in the market of digital assets. Danny Scott is confident that more people will decide to invest in bitcoin with the declining volatility and increasing stability, which should consequently push BTC closer to adoption. Despite high hopes that bitcoin’s latest record provided to crypto enthusiasts and market watchers who are positive about cryptocurrency market, host of Tales from the Crypt, Marty Bent, shared that he doesn’t believe that the low volatility levels will resist market trends, while Bent stresses out that declines in March are more likely a consequence of “exhaustion” in the market of digital assets than a sign of maturation. Bent further added that it is less likely that an asset such as bitcoin has the ability to emerge with perfected scalability, sufficient decentralization and no volatility, not even in the period of a decade since its creation. However, Tales from the Crypt host still believes that the market is on the right track, adding that once the network has a sufficient amount of value, volatility levels should likewise reach a satisfying dose of stability, although this process may take years.",

        "passage": "Since the rise of consumer electronics, especially with smartphones in the past decade, financial technology has become a hot industry. As a result, online banking and digital invoices have become the norm. One analyst, however, predicts that China will take this trend one massive step further, and will convert its entire fiat system to a digital ecosystem, which may be a cryptocurrency based on a private blockchain.  In a recent appearance on Bloomberg TV, Don Tapscott, the co-founder and Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute in Canada, argued that the Chinese government and central bank could turn the Renminbi (RMB), also known as the Yuan, into a cryptocurrency with time. Speaking in response to a question about decentralized crypto exchanges and mining in China, which local authorities are reportedly looking to crack down on, Tapscott, the co-author of all-encompassing blockchain primer “The Blockchain Revolution,” postulated that the reason why the government won’t ban the aforementioned industries is because in “20 years, we are not going to be using Bitcoin in China.” Instead, he claims, locals will be using a cryptocurrency created by the central bank of China, as this would provide more control and efficiency for authorities. While Tapscott finds his argument logical, Agustin Carstens, the general manager at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has remarked that central banks and governments should not issue their own cryptocurrencies. Carstens, a staunch critic of decentralized cryptocurrencies who once called Bitcoin a “bubble, Ponzi scheme, and an environmental disaster” (in one breath no less),  said last month that such initiatives may backfire. As Bloomberg claimed, the skeptic suggested that what he called central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs) would change macroeconomic trends, like interest rates, shifts in central bank balance sheets, and market liquidity at large. Carstens explained: But there may be a reason for China to go ahead with tokenizing/fully digitizing its national currency. As Hasu and Three Arrow Capital’s Su Zhu, who are both crypto industry researchers, explained in a blog post, PayPal, Venmo, and China’s WeChat by extension “remove every need for cash,” as they’re marketed as faster, cheaper, and more efficient forms of payment. While this sounds all well and good in a convenience-seeking world, a nation where all transactions are digital will allow the government to comb through the ins and outs of every citizen’s life, giving them the ability to control and watch society with a Lord Sauron-esque eye. This will promote “surveillance, financial control, and authoritarianism.” And as seen with China’s recent push to establish a “social credit” system, whereas each citizen is ranked based on how they live their lives and the data their devices output, a fully digital, government-backed currency seems to be begging to join that system. But there’s an answer to this existential crisis if the need ever arises: Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency, unlike its centralized counterparts, is not only non-inflationary, but it is also decentralized, non-sovereign, censorship-resistant, and private. The last part there is, in the eyes of BitMEX chief executive Arthur Hayes, what makes Bitcoin especially valuable. Hayes once wrote that as privacy is an integral part of any well-function society, a system like Bitcoin will become more than essential in a society where cash is all but decimated. Zhu and Hasu would agree, as the two wrote that while Bitcoin is viable as a digital store of value, it’s best used as a new breed of money — digital cash, “that combines the benefits of physical cash with the benefits of digital payments.”",

        "passage": "Analysts at Bank of America think current downdraft in cryptocurrency prices could be a harbinger of more pain ahead. They don’t think the sell-off will be limited to the crypto markets, and see the selling pressure in the oil space as part-and-parcel of a much wider movement out of risky assets. According to a report that Reuters reproduced, Bank of America thinks that the action in crypto markets suggests that another “flash crash” could be near. Modern markets are more-or-less directed by trading algorithms, which opens up the door to sudden movements that may make little sense to the humans that can’t react in microseconds.  Bank of America strategists said that: The idea that cryptos and oil are correlated is a new one. The crypto market is still tiny. Over the last week it fell below the $200 billion USD level. That is smaller than many companies that are traded on major exchanges. Strategists at Bank of America see this ongoing selling pressure as evidence of a bear market in the crypto space, and perhaps a broader bias away from risk. There couldn’t be a direct connection between a sell-off in the crypto space and established markets, and cryptos are far too small to affect the wider equity and commodity exchanges. It is true that the crypto space and crude oil have been sold hard over the last month. Industrial metals like copper were hit hard earlier this year, but unlike cryptos and oil, copper prices have been steady over the last month. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) also think that BTC prices are heading lower. According to a report published on November 16, BI thinks that BTC could fall as far as $1,500. That would represent a fall of at least another 60% from current levels, which are lower than many in the crypto community thought were possible. The fall from last year’s highs has been brutal for investors who entered the market late. Current levels are already far below the highs that BTC hit last December, and another major leg down would create near-total losses for anyone who bought cryptos in the late months of 2017. Travis Kling told Bloomberg he “didn’t sleep well” as a result of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, and that, “There’s a small chance that, it’s difficult to estimate, that something really bad could happen related to Bitcoin Cash that could then impact the entire crypto market.” BI analyst Mike McGlone seemed to be on the same page. He was quoted by Bloomberg as saying, that the recent fall, “was sparked by the pump for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.” He went on to posit that the, “pump that began a few weeks ago, got the market a bit too offsides with speculative longs playing for the good-old days. But this is an enduring bear market.” The should be little doubt left that the prices paid for BTC last year were almost wholly speculative in nature. Much of the hype surrounding the first crypto was clearly unjustified, and now people who made major investments in the sector are being hit hard as the price-floor appears to be giving way.  Read: Is Bitcoin in a Bubble? It would be a mistake to underestimate the kind of psychological damage that a speculative bubble can create. The rapid price rise in crypto prices during 2017 demanded the world’s attention, and today people everywhere are watching the sector implode. In time, cryptos may rise from the ashes, but it could take much longer than anyone expects.",

        "passage": "A new report by CipherTrace says that hackers and other cybercriminals stole about $1.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018. The Menlo Park-based blockchain forensic analysis firm says this number represents a fivefold increase from 2017’s figures. In a new document titled “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2018 Q4,” CipherTrace revealed that “bad actors” successfully stole $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies from hacks and other elaborate scams. Out of this number, about $950 million came from cyberattacks on Bitcoin exchanges.  The remainder came from ICO exit scams, Ponzi schemes, mobile phone sim swaps, etc. Researchers at CipherTrace say these exit scams cost investors $750 million in 2018. Back in August 2018, data from blockchain analytics firm, Diar, revealed that five ICOs stole close to $100 million from unsuspecting investors. According to the report, cryptocurrency theft in 2018 increased by more than 400 percent. This surge occurred despite a year-long bear market for virtual currencies with prices falling by over 80 percent. The document also revealed the emergence of a new cyberthreat to the industry. This new wave of bad actors, according to the report comes from people working within firms in the market looking to exploit investors. Commenting on the matter, Dave Jevans, the company CEO, said: While cybercriminals may have increased their loot in 2018, CipherTrace says they will need to successfully launder their ill-gotten gains before newly enacted anti-money laundering (AML) regulations come into effect. An excerpt from the report reads: Concerning cryptocurrency exchange hacks, the report revealed that platforms in Japan and South Korea suffered the most. Indeed, 2018 began with the over $500 million hack of Tokyo-based Coincheck. Platforms like Bithumb and Zaif also fell victim to cryptocurrency hackers. In total, the report says hackers stole 3.6 times more than in 2017 and seven times more than in 2016. In response, places like South Korea and Japan have tried to firm up regulations to prevent such attacks. Apart from several policies enacted by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), regulators also gave green light from self-regulation. Outside Japan and South Korea, investors in Vietnam also lost about $35 million to the Sky Mining scam. In a related development, another new report, this time by Chainalysis revealed that most of cryptocurrency exchange hacks were the work of two syndicates. According to Chainalysis, two groups dubbed “Alpha” and “Beta” were responsible for more than 60 percent of all attacks against Bitcoin exchanges. Going by the report, it appears that crypto cybercrimes, at the least the ones targeted at exchange platforms might be the work of centralized syndicates. The report also alleged that both groups have different motives for their attacks. The Beta group is reportedly interested in getting rich from their loot. However, the Alpha group could have far more sinister motivations for their actions. Meanwhile, 2019 which is barely a month old has already registered its first cryptocurrency exchange hack. This time, New Zealand-based Cryptopia is the victim. According to reports, hackers stole more than $16 million in Ethereum tokens from the platform. A recent report by blockchain analysis firm, Elementus, the group responsible for the Cryptopia hack resumed their attack after a two-week dormancy period. The firm believes that Cryptopia no longer has access to its wallets meaning that the hackers can continue to siphon funds.",

        "passage": "The cryptoeconomy saw a series of stark selloffs across the board in 2018, and general rallies in its markets have been few and far between since then. Accordingly, traders perked up on Monday, February 18th, as the top 25 cryptocurrencies were all in the green on the day, several markedly so. Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency per market capitalization, seemed to lead the latest buy swell, its price having gained nine percent from $123 USD to $134 on Sunday while most other big-cap and mid-cap cryptocurrencies were still flat. As Monday arrived, the ether price took another 10 percent climb from $134 to a high above $148 while buy pressure began hitting the other top cryptocurrency markets.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose more than seven percent in the rally to reach $3900, a mark that’s within striking distance of the round and psychological $4,000 price point. The move up comes as the genesis cryptocurrency had settled amid sideways chop around $3,500 in recent weeks. Other popular assets fared just as well on the green day. Ripple’s XRP, Tron (TRX), and stellar lumens (XLM) all gained more than six percent respectively. The biggest rises among the top coins came from EOS (+22 percent), bitcoin cash (+19 percent), litecoin (+12 percent), and Cardano’s ADA (+12 percent). The top privacy coins, Monero and Zcash, each saw their prices rise more than eight percent. There have been acute daily rallies in the current cryptoeconomy bear market, which earlier this month became the longest in Bitcoin’s history to date. But what’s been lacking in the downturn is consecutive days of upward momentum. The sharp rise of the ether price two days in a row has some traders in the space wondering if the beginning of the end is nigh for the bearish market cycle. Bullish rumblings this February have price watchers wondering what comes next. On Feb. 8th, cryptocurrency markets saw their last rally with litecoin leading the way atop a 30 percent rise. That surge combined with the latest round of buy pressure may suggest that demand, whether it be retail or institutional demand, is materializing once more around the top digital assets. Fundstrat, the firm of high-profile Wall Street cryptocurrency analyst Tom Lee, thinks the page will be turning for the ecosystem this year. Fundstrat published its 2019 crypto outlook two weeks ago, and in it the firm projected the bear market would bottom out within the next several months. Of course, that estimation is a far cry from saying a bull run is imminent, and as always it’s anyone’s guess where cryptocurrency markets go from here, but the firm’s bottom call is another sign that optimism seems to be returning to the space after sentiments turned generally bleak in 2018. Even a modest recovery throughout the year would be welcomed by cryptocurrency diehards, as it’s now been more than 400 days since bitcoin peaked near $20,000 in December 2017. As such, any steps toward that mark will be championed by proponents in perpetuity. Unless, that is, the bitcoin price ever breaks through $20k again, at which their hopes of a return will have been borne out. But the cryptoeconomy isn’t out of the wood’s just yet. Concerns about the possibility of a global economic recession still linger around the world stage, and if such a recession were to occur, a de-risking investment atmosphere would reign supreme for the interim. Speculative assets like cryptocurrencies would likely be among the investment instruments hit hardest if global markets go down. For now, the only thing to do is wait and see what happens next.",

        "passage": "Australia’s consumer protection watchdog says instances of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related fraud increased by nearly 200 percent in 2018. Despite the year-long bear market that characterized the period, it appears cryptocurrency con-artists continue to enjoy relative success defrauding unsuspecting victims. Meanwhile, even with the rising figures, cryptocurrency-related fraud continues to constitute an insignificant portion of financial crimes in Australia and several other countries around the world.  According to a recently published report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Bitcoin fraudsters earned about $4.3 million from various fraudulent cryptocurrency-related schemes in 2018. This figure represents a 190 percent increase from the total sum recorded in 2017. The consumer protection watchdog says it recorded about 674 incidents of suspected scams that mostly targeted men aged 25 to 34. Most of these fraudulent schemes used social media platforms and emails to attract potential victims. In the report titled “Targeting scams: Report of the ACCC on scams activity 2018,” the regulatory agency declared that investment fraud was the most popular scam. This type of scam accounted for about 42 percent of recorded losses ($1.8 million). An excerpt from the report reads: According to the report, other cryptocurrency-related scams involved the use of Bitcoin ATMs. There are currently 22 Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, with nine located in Sydney alone. The 190 percent increase in Bitcoin fraud in Australia occurred during a period when the cryptocurrency market as a whole experienced a massive value decline. The bear market of 2018 saw prices fall by more than 80 percent across the entire cryptocurrency market. However, the ACCC reports that the state of the market did little to discourage fraudsters from using Bitcoin as a means to scam their victims. The ACCC said scammers took advantage of the left-over hype from late 2017 to lure more victims into fraudulent investment schemes in 2018. In many of the reported cases, the con artists chose to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a way of circumventing security protocols used by banks. According to the ACCC report: As previously reported by Blockonomi, scam statistics showed Australians losing more than $14 million to scams in 2019 as at the end of March 2019. As at the time of writing this article, the figure has risen to $25 million. Even with the 190 percent increase, Bitcoin fraud still accounts for a minute portion of the total financial crimes’ scene in Australia. According to ACCC figures, the total recorded losses from the more than 170,000 reported scams stood at $75 million. Thus, cryptocurrency-related fraud only amounted to five percent of the total losses attributed to con artists in the country. The figures from Australia follow the trend seen in many different countries. Earlier in 2019, the National Police Agency of Japan released its money laundering report for 2018. Bitcoin-related money laundering only constituted about 1.7 percent of all recorded cases. Apart from financial crimes, security experts also remain unanimous in the declaration that criminal elements like drug cartels and jihadists aren’t adopting cryptocurrency with cash still the preferred conduit for their illegal activities.",

        "passage": "It might be a while before you can purchase your home with any cryptocurrency at all. British news agency The Times reported on April 28 that the Aston Plaza in Dubai, a popular Bitcoin-based real estate development project, will be putting its operations on hold, until further notice. The real estate project cost a reported £250 million ($325 million), and it was developed by Scottish fashion designer and parliamentarian Baroness Michelle Mone, and her partner Douglas Barrowman, a Scottish investor and the Chairman of the Knox Group of Companies.  The couple launched the real estate project back in 2017, touting it as the first housing project where tenants could pay in Bitcoin. At the time, Barrowman had explained to CNBC on why they chose the cryptocurrency, describing Bitcoin as an emerging trend that would one day become a more mainstream means of investment. Barrowman had said: At its launch, Mone and Barrowman promised to complete construction by the summer of 2019, saying that they would be offering 150 out of the 1,300 apartments on the project to investors who could pay in Bitcoin. The couple reported to Business Insider in February 2018 that they had successfully sold 50 of the apartments already. Speaking with the financial news medium, Mone claimed that some buyers bought two apartments each, while one person even bought as many as ten. As at the time of the sale announcement, the properties that were on offer ranged from simple studios, priced at $130,000 a piece (roughly 15.5 BTC as at then) to two-bedroom apartments that went for $380,000 (about 45 BTC). The project’s website shows that studios and two-bedroom apartments are now being offered for as low as 9 BTC. However, the site also points out that the listing prices are pegged to the value of BTC to the US Dollar as at January 8, 2018, which means that 9 BTC would amount to roughly $147,000 (as opposed to its value of $48,780 at press time. The reason for Aston’s suspension is still unknown. However, that isn’t to say that other companies aren’t doing their bit to revolutionize the real estate market. Last week, Smartlands, a British blockchain firm, announced that it would be launching its platform in a matter of weeks. The Smartlands platform would provide liquidity in the real estate market by allowing developers to issue tokens that are linked to a specific property. The tokens can be bought and traded both on the platform and in a secondary crypto market. The company’s announcement, which was published on April 26, gave users an overview of how the platform will work. Smartlands’ CEO Arnold Nauseda also noted that the tokens would allow investors to hold a fraction of a building’s equity. Investors get their returns in the form of rent, and on property sales.",

        "passage": "In September 2017, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch branch asked 200 institutional investors what they believe is the most popular investment. Most of them said “Long Bitcoin.” That said, this doesn’t mean these investors have put money into the digital asset. However, it does show the government how vital cryptocurrencies are in the long run. But, that doesn’t change the fact that the crypto market needs institutional investors to take off. Thankfully, there is some hope in that regard thanks to recent developments.  As of this writing, “established financial institutions” are finally preparing to work with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Groups like Fidelity, one of the biggest asset managers in the world, revealed it would start supporting crypto trading and offer custody platforms within the next few months. Then, we have the Intercontinental Exchange which is getting ready for a Bitcoin futures exchange called Bakkt. Later, other places like American universities such as MIT and Harvard are creating cryptocurrency funds. This is just the start. It remains to be seen, then, why the value of Bitcoin hasn’t taken off despite these accomplishments. Instead, market optimists are looking for any small positives we can find. Unfortunately, Bitcoin broke the $6,000 low investors had established for it late last year and is now stuck around $3,000. Whales are holding steady, but new investors are failing to enter the market. Plus, we need institutional investors over smaller common ones. Of course, a significant limitation here is a lack of any framework for investors to follow regarding Bitcoin. P.A.I.D. Strategies recently released a report that claims 68% of Bitcoin exchanges across the United States and Europe aren’t even compliant towards know-your-customer policies. Plus, a decent amount of these exchanges can’t even liquify Bitcoin or other assets. That’s not a good pitch for new investors with lots of money to enter the market. John Devlin, a head analyst at P.A.I.D. spoke on this: Of course, this burden relies mostly on cryptocurrency exchanges, as these are key entry points into the digital asset market. Fortunately, Tony Sio, the head of surveillance and marketplace at Nasdaq, recently spoke on the matter, saying that crypto exchanges are doing what they can to improve their offerings. He goes on, speaking to Business Insider and saying that a decent amount of exchanges are asking Nasdaq to use their SMARTS Trade Surveillance system. This network is used by traditional exchanges, brokers, and regulatory officials to watch over trading and keep an eye on possible market manipulation. That said, because Nasdaq screens platforms before allowing them into the SMARTS platform, Sio claims that he’s seen a good amount of crypto platforms with poor KYC/AML policies. To be fair, these barriers aren’t always easy to implement. “If you are a startup, it is quite hard to set up because it requires a fair bit of work to set it up fully in place,” says Sio. “That is probably one of the sticking points.” Nevertheless, some crypto exchanges have been approved by Nasdaq. Those in the green are utilizing surveillance technology, trading engines, clearing engines, and more. This is a great sign, as it shows exchanges are putting effort into showing themselves as ideal candidates to follow. If this continues, institutional investors will be more likely to jump into the market despite volatility and other longstanding issues.",

        "passage": "The Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom’s top financial regulator, is moving against cryptocurrency derivatives products being accessible to everyday consumers. The watchdog, which works independently of the U.K. government, announced on July 3rd it was proposing to ban the “sale, marketing and distribution” of cryptocurrency-based exchange-trade products (ETPs) and derivatives — for example, futures offerings — to “all retail consumers.” The FCA has followed up the proposal — whose underlying work began last fall — by opening a consultation period in which a wide variety of industry participants can provide their positions on the would-be ban.  The authority cited companies that create or market crypto derivatives, exchanges, and retails investors as among the types of stakeholders suited for submitting feedback. In their Wednesday announcement, the FCA said the ban proposal was driven by a concern that retail investors weren’t savvy enough to “reliably assess the value and risks” of cryptocurrency derivatives. The authority said concerns over consumer incompetence stemmed from their perception that cryptocurrencies bear “no reliable basis for valuation”; are vulnerable to market manipulation; have a propensity for extreme volatility; and fail to demonstrate a “a clear investment need for investment products referencing them.” In other words, the FCA thinks average investors shouldn’t have anything to do with crypto derivatives. The watchdog estimated that a ban on such products could save as much as £75m annually by preventing domestic consumers from losing funds. The authority will process the feedback and make a final decision after the consultation period closes on July 10th. If the ban is green-lighted, the FCA will develop an official policy and formally publish it in the first quarter of next year. It seems the restrictions are more likely than not for now, if the watchdog’s already developing arguments are any indication. “There is growing evidence that cryptoassets are causing harm to consumers and markets,” the FCA said in its ban proposal. In January, the FCA released a consultation advisory in which it put forth tentative standards for what types of tokens were within its jurisdiction. In that advisory, the authority outlined what it saw as the three main types of cryptocurrency tokens: exchange tokens, utility tokens, and security tokens. Exchange tokens were said to be ones like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), whereas utility tokens were crypto assets that performed specific utilities on their respective networks. The FCA went on to argue that only security tokens fell within its jurisdiction, and that tokens could only be securities if they literally functioned like a debt instrument or a company share. At the time, legal experts in the cryptoeconomy applauded the nuance and implications of the authority’s classifications. The FCA’s new ban proposal on crypto derivatives shows the watchdog is also perfectly willing to disallow what it views as dangerous crypto investments where it can. In a first-ever milestone, the U.K. financial regulator approved an operational license for a cryptocurrency asset management firm. That firm, Prime Factor Capital, is headquartered out of London and manages cryptocurrency investments previously capped at the €100 million euro mark. With that FCA license now in tow, the hedge fund can expand its assets under management (AUM) higher than that threshold. The license officially slots the firm as an alternative investment fund manager within the European Union — a dynamic that means the fund can now also expand its reach further into Europe. With the company having paved the way toward FCA licensing, other similarly crypto-minded funds will certainly follow in its wake to achieve the regulator’s blessings.",

        "passage": "Last week, the crypto market saw a historic event: both Bitcoin and Libra were mentioned in name by the sitting American President. Surprisingly enough, Donald Trump’s thoughts, or his administration’s thoughts rather, weren’t all optimistic. In a three-part Twitter thread that got picked up by just about every mainstream outlet, the businessman-turned-world leader was overtly bearish on Bitcoin, calling it volatile, inherently invaluable, and a medium for criminal financial activity.  As a result of this sudden tweetstorm, which many say would cement Bitcoin as “dangerous” in the eyes of millions, some investors began to run scared. The tweets, in fact, may be a way to explain Bitcoin’s move to $9,900. But, despite this, analysts and industry commentators are sure that in the long run, Trump’s tweet will only help to bolster the viability of the cryptocurrency industry. Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ resident cryptocurrency bull, Thomas Lee, made it clear that he’s unfazed by Trump’s impassioned roast of this budding industry. In the interview, Lee said that all things considered, the tweets are “positive” because they cement the idea that cryptocurrencies are a relevant topic on the global geopolitical and macroeconomic stage. Indeed, over the past few weeks, the words “Bitcoin”, “Libra”, and “Crypto” have begun to grace mainstream outlets and government hearings time and time again. That’s not all, as the markets analyst went on to suggest, Trump’s comments “makes the other 99% [of the world] more aware [of cryptocurrency].” And if 1% of this new audience somehow finds value in the cryptocurrency market, the size of the community surrounding this asset class would de-facto double instantly.  “It’s going to force everybody who is not involved — and remember a very small percentage actually cares about crypto and bitcoin — it’s going to force the other 98% of the world to think about what it means,” he added while in discussion with Yahoo’s anchors. That’s not all. As RT contributor Max Keiser explained, Trump’s anti-Bitcoin stance should force nations that are anti-Trump to look into cryptocurrencies to spite the American leader. In a world of ever-growing tension between nations on different sides of the political spectrum, this may not be as crazy as it sounds. Trump’s ability to boost the network effects of Bitcoin isn’t the only bullish sign in the eyes of Lee. From previous interviews and comments, it is clear that the Fundstrat co-founder has begun to identify a confluence of factors that could be a boon for BTC. These positive catalysts include the launch of Libra, which analyst Luke Martin suggested may be the biggest onramp to Bitcoin ever; a growth in cases of dovish fiscal policy, which some say will increase the chances of a recession and large inflationary events; and geopolitical tension that could only bolster the fundamental need for decentralized money. All this, Lee explains, could help Bitcoin in reaching the $20,000 to $40,000 range by the end of the year. He elaborates: A model from a prominent cryptocurrency fund manager, Timothy Peterson, also suggests that BTC hitting $40,000 is likely. Peterson recently noted that it’s possible to relate Bitcoin’s performance in the first half of any given year to the second half with a model. The model he derived suggests that since BTC rallied nearly 200% from January to the end of June, it has the potential of moving higher by around another 250% from year-to-date high levels.",

        "passage": "As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has boomed, so have the number of incumbents of traditional finance and politics taking to the streets to bash cryptocurrency. In Washington, D.C. on Thursday, one American politician — and a prominent one at that —  suggested that cryptocurrencies should be banned. Yikes. (Note: there is some opinion scattered through this piece.)  During Thursday’s Financial Services Committee hearing, U.S. Congressman Bradley Sherman, who represents the Democrats in California — the home of technological innovation of all places — suddenly brought on cryptocurrencies. During his rant-esque statement, which was recorded by industry non-profit Coin Center, Sherman remarked that Congress should outlaw cryptocurrencies for U.S. citizens. He remarked: Sherman explained that cryptocurrencies are starting to enter the realm of “illicit finance”, specifically looking to how the Hamas militia is seeking funding through Bitcoin. He then goes on to describe Bitcoin’s premise as one built on libertarianism and anarchism, which is, to his credit, true. Yet, he goes on to represent the entire cryptocurrency space like it is predicated on tax evasion, drug dealing, and what have you, effectively forgetting to realize that this technological advancement is so much more than what he mentioned, not to mention that the U.S. dollar is used for questionable acts too. Furthering his narrative, Sherman jokes that “crypto is the plastic gun of currency.” He then concluded his statement by drawing attention to the fact that cryptocurrency undermines the value proposition of the U.S. dollar, quipping that something like Bitcoin could “disempower foreign policy, tax collection enforcement, and traditional law enforcement.” JP Morgan & Chase’s Jamie Dimon would surely be proud.  The funny thing about this, as pointed out by Twitter commentator The Crypto Dog, is that Sherman may be slightly hypocritical when using the “illicit finance” narrative. Although the Congressman has never participated in such heinous acts before, his campaign’s top funder is from a company that had to forfeit $13.3 million. What for, you ask? Well, apparently the company was involved in illegal online gambling, and thus was required to fork over that money to the Feds. What’s more, the campaign donor list for Sherman is spotted with American banks and traditional institutions, making it no surprise that he’s pushing back against an innovation that could usurp the foundation he stands upon. Color me surprised, I’ll wait.  We have covered Brad Sherman and his conflicts of interest before here on Blockonomi. This odd case of Bitcoin bashing, alongside a similar case seen just days ago with Nobel Prize-endowed economist Joseph Stiglitz, has resulted in the cryptocurrency community taking up arms. Not only does an event band the industry together. Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Capital hints at the fact that Sherman likely understands very little about Bitcoin, let alone cryptocurrency or blockchain, making it nonsensical to call for a ban. Pompliano added, “Bitcoin will be around long after Mr. Sherman.”  As industry journalist Kyle Torpey noted, Sherman’s attempt to spark anti-Bitcoin bills is actually a solid advertisement for the cryptocurrency, as it literally shows how scared the U.S. is of its dollar losing hegemony as the world’s go-to asset. Jimmy Song, an industry educator, adds that this is a clear sign that Bitcoin is reaching the point in its life during which those stuck in the past are trying to stop something inevitable, this being the rise of a sound, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and digital money that breaks all traditional boundaries.",

        "passage": "According to a report from local news outlet Focus Taiwan, Taiwanese police based in New Taipei, recently arrested 15 alleged cryptocurrency scam operators. The report claims that the suspects duped investors out of about $8 million as money collected for trading banned IBCoin tokens. The news is coming barely ten days after the state indicted seven other suspects for managing a crypto-based investment scam that attracted about $51 million in investments from over 1,000 investors. A local report, had noted at the time, that the suspects had run a scheme that promised investors returns of up to 355%.  According to the reports released by the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), the activities of these fraudsters revolved around IBCoin, a digital asset based on Ethereum’s ERC20 technology, that has already been banned for use by the Taiwanese authorities. Also, the CIB reports that the coin, which isn’t being traded or dealt with by any known company, doesn’t “have any real value.” The fraudsters allegedly embarked on false publicity efforts on various social media platforms as a means of luring unsuspecting victims. In addition to that, the leader of the group, whose surname was given as Lin, was reportedly purchasing IBCoin tokens from foreign traders at a price of NT$1.5 per unit (the equivalent of $0.05) back in 2017. Then, with the help of the other arrested contractors and traders, he sold the tokens to investors for rates as high as NT$50 to NT$100 (between $1.63 and $3.27), with the promise of higher returns.  Image © Focus Taiwan The group is said to have made about NNT$250 million (roughly $8.16 million) from the scam. On the flip side, the CIB reports that no single investor had profited from the scheme since it launched. Apart from the lack of returns given to investors, the group also reportedly drew additional scrutiny thanks to the luxury, investor-bankrolled lifestyle that they lived. The group floated luxury cars on social media as a means of showing off their wealth and luring more investors. The scammers have been charged with fraud, and the CIB has already handed the case over to the Taipei District Prosecutors Officer, who is expected to set a proper trial date in the coming days. The CIB also stated that they have been able to recover over NT$2.02 million (about $70,000) in cash, along with three vehicles and written documents about the fraudulent scheme, while conducting two separate raids on January 9 and 17. Back in November 2018, Taiwanese authorities introduced sterner Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies as a means of ensuring that crypto exchanges in the country help to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies or fraudulent activities. Amongst other things, the Money Laundering Control Act and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act gave Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) complete oversight over crypto exchanges in the country and the prerogative to ban any crypto-based transactions that it deemed as fraudulent According to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Justice, the move was carried out in an attempt to ensure that the Taiwanese-crypto based companies maintain a “compliance culture and mindset,” which will help the government meet up with international AML standards. Still, it would seem that the stringent AML laws haven’t been as effective as the Taiwanese government would have hoped, as crypto scams are still quite popular in the country. In December 2018, local news reported that a Taiwanese man, whose surname was given as Yang, was accused of stealing $3 million worth of electricity to mine Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) worth 100 million Yuan (about $14.5 million). The suspect was reported to have over 17 business premises pen cafes and toy shops as fronts for his business. He reportedly hired electricians to wire the electrical systems of these businesses to avoid any metering or detection. However, an investigation was launched when the Taiwan Power Company noticed discrepancies in the power supply.",

        "passage": "Canadian crypto exchange Maple Change has been hacked. The company is reporting over $5 million in losses – virtually all its funds – and says it cannot pay any of its customers back. However, many are questioning whether the company was hacked or if the loss was something planned by internal representatives, as the operator of Maple Change website ultimately removed all related internet presence before being identified by “online detectives.”  Based in Edmonton, Maple Change says that all its money has been stolen. After deleting its internet presence temporarily, various customers published the IP address of the company’s owner, prompting the exchange to immediately re-establish itself online. The hack allegedly took place on Sunday October 28, roughly six days after the company handled trades equaling nearly $64,000 in BTC. This was later followed by an upgrade to its server and then the attack, which representatives initially mentioned on Twitter: Many customers challenged the validity of these statements, to which Maple Change responded: The closing of the company’s many related accounts prompted several people to declare the maneuver an exit scam, in which the people behind the exchange are the ones responsible for the stolen funds. At the time of writing, the amount of money stolen is alleged to be roughly $5.9 million. After a user discovered a chief executive’s IP address and published it for all respective customers to see, Maple Change issued a statement online, explaining: The company later explained that most of its funds would be going to the developers responsible for creating the exchange’s remaining coins: Maple Change also said that it would not be refunding any bitcoin or Litecoin funds at this time. Changpeng Zhao – CEO of crypto exchange Binance – took to Twitter to renounce Maple Change for not using cold wallet storage. He later explained that someone should create a list of all the world’s crypto exchanges and rank them according to their storage techniques. He states: Interestingly, around the time of the reported hack, Maple Change garnered its highest amount of traffic in roughly six months, another reason why people are suspicious of the company’s reports. However, Maple Change is not listed on CoinMarketCap.com, which suggests that its daily trading volume is less than significant. Maple Exchange presently ranks amongst the lowest crypto platforms on the CMC charts.",

        "passage": "Cryptocurrency exchange behemoth, Coinbase has decommissioned its political action committee (PAC). This move comes after nine months after the San Francisco-based exchange service created the PAC which incidentally did not raise any funds. Meanwhile, there continues to be a growing intersection of cryptocurrency and politics not just in the United States but in other countries as well. With virtual currencies enjoying a period of significant gains, Bitcoin and the likes have become even more popular topics of conversation in the political sphere.  According to the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC), Coinbase submitted a termination report for its PAC on Wednesday (April 3, 2019). Details released by the FEC show that the Coinbase PAC registered zero fundraising on spending activities during its tenure. The FEC has yet to approve the request to terminate the PAC. Thus, Coinbase will have to continue providing filing disclosures though it seems unlikely that any money will flow through the PAC. The news of the termination comes less than a year after the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange giant first created the PAC. Called the Coinbase Inc., PAC, it became public knowledge via an FEC filing back in July 2018. At the time, commentators espoused the idea of the PAC being an attempt by the Coinbase hierarchy to increase their lobbying efforts in Washington. With the mid-term elections approaching several stakeholders in the U.S. cryptocurrency scene were trying to back politicians with a friendly disposition to virtual currencies. Earlier in 2018, Andreessen Horowitz and other VC juggernauts launched a plan to lobby the U.S. Congress for more crypto-friendly regulations. Many stakeholders expressed concerns over the approach being taken by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the Coinbase PAC might not have yielded any donations or funded any candidates, there is an observable uptrend in the relationship between cryptocurrency companies and those on Capitol Hill. Most of the lobbying efforts seemed geared towards the emergence of regulations that will promote the growth of the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. These efforts might be yielding fruit in the form of the Token Taxonomy Act, as well as a patchwork of cryptocurrency and blockchain-friendly legislations being passed in different State Senates. Despite the progress made thus far, there are still some contentions over proposals like the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for virtual currencies. Critics say the regulatory framework offers no property rights for virtual currency holders and does not ensure super-negotiability for cryptocurrency transactions. Andrew Yang, a U.S. presidential hopeful of the Democratic Party has even put clear-cut cryptocurrency regulations as one of his campaign promises. So far, the U.S. continues to be behind other countries in the area of establishing a firm regulatory environment for virtual currencies. Outside of the United States, there are developing political undertones to cryptocurrency adoption for countries like Russia, Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, to mention a few. Rumors have recently emerged saying Russia used Bitcoin to support newly elected Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela appear to be embracing cryptocurrency as a means of circumventing U.S. economic sanctions. Following the collapse of the country’s economy, citizens of Venezuela have taken to Bitcoin mining as a way of ensuring their continued survival. Several cybersecurity experts allege that North Korea is behind the hacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. Reports indicate that Pyongyang is using the proceeds of these hacks to continue its nuclear weapons program.",

        "passage": "HSBC India has completed a first of its kind blockchain enable transaction in partnership with ING Bank Brussels between Indian Holding juggernaut Reliance Industries (RIL) and its client in the U.S., according to reports by local Indian newspaper The Hindu Business Line. The transaction was in the form of a blockchain enabled Letter of Credit (LoC), necessitated by the shipment sent out from Reliance Industries to U.S energy company Tricon Energy, leading to a substantial reduction in the cost and time of processing documents.  Based on the report, the issuing bank for the LoC was ING Bank, while HSBC India, advised and negotiated on behalf of Reliance Industries. R3’s Corda platform facilitated the end-to-end transaction. The news outlet believes the new system is an improvement to how partners interact regarding exports in India, as it brings both parties together on one platform. The traditional way of facilitating such a transaction includes sending physical copies of LoCs to each party in the transaction. The Hindu Business Line quoted HSBC India in a statement stating: The bank went further to state: Hitendra Dave, Head-Global Banking and Markets, HSBC India was also quoted by the news outlet, where he hailed the use of blockchain for trade as it “enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster.” The new solution was implemented in line with the integration of an Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) called Bolero. Combining the features of a legal framework and technology, this eBL “replicates the core elements of a traditional paper bill of lading.” Bolero was introduced in November 2016 as a platform where trading partners can introduce documents, allowing them to settle international trade faster and improve the cycle.  The eBL allows “carriers and logistics providers the ability to create, send, amend and manage bills of lading digitally with greater accuracy, integrity, and speed. This reduces the likelihood of any potential fraud, errors and the cost of administration,” according to Bolero’s website.  At the time of the launch, the Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance for HSBC India had stated the importance of Bolero for cross-border trade.  “This first step we’ve taken with e-Presentation has big implications for companies in India and elsewhere. It shows that the participants in cross-border trade – from producers to banks and shippers – are willing to collaborate to achieve an end-to-end digital transaction. It also shows that collaboration is worthwhile, optimizing companies’ working capital so they can move on to their next deal sooner.” Other companies that have been trialing the use of blockchain as a substitute for traditional trade documents include BBVA, which use a platform created by Wave to cut down on their transaction time from seven to 10 days to less than 3 hours. The transaction involved was the exportation of more than 25 tons of frozen tuna from Pinsa Congelados, of Mazatlan, México. Payments were made by a BBVA issued LoC and processed by Bancomer in Mexico. Patxi Fernández de Trocóniz, head of global trade & international banking, BBVA, had stated at the time: “The pilot we carried out with Wave represents a leap forward in improving the efficiency of international trade transactions. The time it takes to manage the documentation was reduced to a process that lasted just a few hours, in which all parties – the banks, the importer and the exporter – were constantly aware of the status of the documents.”",

What they have in common is big backers and the status of having their respective mainnets, or live networks, not yet online. Yet — in what’s already proven to be a busy week for cryptoeconomy headlines — both upstarts have made fresh announcements that reveal each is respectively making strides toward bringing their mainnets online.  Where these projects will eventually settle in the wider blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem is an open question. But their builders are making the moves needed now to set these platforms up for potential success later. Filecoin, the decentralized storage network created by the Protocol Labs team, is being created to let users exchange unused storage space through an open marketplace. And stakeholders in the project now have a target launch date for its mainnet: spring 2020. That’s per a new Filecoin update this week, in which the project estimated its testnet launch would come on December 11th, 2019, and its mainnet activation would happen in March 2020. The Filecoin team noted these dates could be changed later, but they offer a general roadmap forward for now. “The most important news in this update is that we’re getting very close to launching the network,” Filecoin said.  The project, which counts among its investors Y Combinator and Winklevoss Capital, is being built as an incentive layer atop the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), itself a decentralized data storage solution built by Protocol Labs. Filecoin will be comprised of blockchain and will have a native token, filecoin, that will be used in its storage transactions. The materializing project is known in the cryptocurrency space for having conducted one of the most lucrative token offerings in 2017, a year when initial coin offering (ICO) buzz reached feverish proportions. Facilitated through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) model, the Filecoin ICO raised $205 million USD at the time. These SAFTs can be redeemed once the network’s mainnet is activated. Recently, Coinbase noted filecoin tokens were among a host of new projects the popular cryptocurrency exchange was considering adding support for. This week, O(1) Labs — the development company behind the “tiny blockchain in your browser” Coda Protocol project — announced they had enlisted the help of two influential industry experts to help make the succinct blockchain a reality. Specifically, O(1) Labs has just established its so-called Testnet Advisory Board and has added Luke Youngblood and Zaki Manian to the group’s ranks as technical advisors. The body will be responsible for generally advancing the development of the Coda Protocol. Hired by Coinbase earlier this year, Youngblood is known in cryptocurrency circles for being a key figure behind the launch of Tezos, as the engineer built out the staking infrastructure for the network on behalf of the Tezos Foundation. “I’m excited about the potential of Coda to enable developers to build truly decentralized apps,” Youngblood said. For his part, Zaki Manian is Head of Research at Tendermint, the team behind the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Now, he and Youngblood will help steer Coda Protocol on its own path toward fruition. “The Testnet Advisory Board will allow us to iterate even more quickly towards a mainnet candidate,’ noted Evan Shapiro, co-founder and chief executive officer at O(1) Labs, in welcoming the new advisors. It’s been full steam ahead for the project so far in 2019. Back in April, O(1) Labs announced a $15 million fundraising round that saw investments from Coinbase Ventures and beyond. “Over the next few months, we’ll be inviting users to become more deeply involved with Coda,”O(1) Labs said at the time.",

        "passage": "Many of you are probably familiar with Telegram, a chat app that allow you to access all kinds of different channels and garner information pertaining to some of your favorite subjects. You can talk to anyone in the world using Telegram, but the app offers more than just chat options – it boasts its own crypto. Unfortunately, not everyone’s happy about this. The nation of Iran, which has had a rather mixed to negative relationship with cryptocurrencies, is now banning access to Telegram in its attempts to crackdown on the usage of digital assets, which regulators say bring criminal activity to Iran. Secretary of the Criminal Content Definition Task Force Javad Javidnia says that anyone caught using Telegram in Iran or utilizing Gram – the app’s cryptocurrency – will be subject to national security laws and will be given the appropriate punishment.  In addition, regulators will also see the action as a means of disrupting the national economy. Kind of a harsh move on their part, but in any case, users can expect to see officials bringing the hammer down if they step out of place. Javidnia explains: Iran isn’t the only region to look down on Telegram and consider it a national threat. In Russia, Telegram has also been banned when in 2018, the chat application held its own initial coin offering (ICO). Russian officials explained they were worried about the fundraising plan due to potential fraud and lagging investor safety.  Read: The Telegram ICO Has Raised a Massive $1.7 Billion So Far Iran believes Telegram’s entry into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space could “undermine the national currency of Iran.” The country is under strict sanctions set forth by President Donald Trump and the United States and has experienced inflation and economic damage as a result. To be fair, however, Iran has always held a particularly negative attitude towards cryptocurrency, having gone so far as to restrict access to cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018 thanks, in part, to bitcoin’s increased popularity among the country’s residents. At the same time, however, the country has been discussing the notion of building its own cryptocurrency for years as a way of avoiding sanctions in the future, though it appears officials don’t want any competition getting in the way. The country’s central bank is reportedly working with other institutions to control the influx of digital currencies in Iran like bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to discourage their use and get residents to see the national virtual currency as their only payment option. Last February, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi – minister of Iran’s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology – released the following message on Twitter: In 2017, the country temporarily restricted access to both Telegram and the social media giant Instagram after a nationwide protest. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also enforced a full ban on Telegram use by government officials following the protest’s breakup. Iran isn’t the only rogue nation to try and pull its own cryptocurrency out of a hat. 2018 was saturated with stories regarding Venezuela and the petro, a digital asset that President Nicolas Maduro alleged was backed by the country’s many oil reserves. The currency has spawned controversy throughout the industry and petro-trading has been officially banned in the U.S.",

This week, the company kept that trend alive in unveiling two long-awaited functionalities: the release of the full version of its Android Ledger Live mobile app and the activation of Cardano (ADA) support on its popular Ledger Nano S wallet. The developments come after Ledger’s Nano S received a security certificate from France’s top cybersecurity watchdog earlier this month, making Ledger the first crypto wallet manufacturer to receive any such kind of government certification.  Previously limited to a consultation-only mode, the Ledger Live mobile app has now been entirely opened up for Android users. Users of the Android 7.0 operating system and beyond can now use the Ledger Live app to view their cryptocurrency holdings and facilitate Nano S transactions right from their phones. The wallet manufacturer noted that iOS users will still only be able to use the mobile app’s consultation mode due to “technical limitations.” In their announcement, the Ledger team characterized the production as another step toward using smartphones to help bring crypto into the mainstream: On March 26th, Ledger and EMURGO — the enterprise wing of the Cardano ecosystem — declared that the hardware wallet manufacturer had integrated support for ADA, the Cardano blockchain’s native asset, on the Ledger Nano S.  On the news, Ledger’s social media team called ADA “possibly the most requested crypto by our community.” The integration will make it possible for holders to use their Nano S alongside the EMURGO-backed Yoroi wallet or the open-source ADALite wallet. Commenting on the move, Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque noted how ADA support had been particularly long-awaited in light of the Cardano project’s rise to prominence since 2017: As for Cardano itself, its builders just released the blockchain’s v1.5 software, which notably is the last big upgrade before the project enters its major Shelly development period. Last week, Ledger announced its Nano S wallet had received a security certification from the National Agency for Information Systems Security, or ANSSI, France’s top cybersecurity watchdog that answers to the nation’s Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security.  The certification, also known as the First Level Security Certificate, comes as part of a “process for undergoing evaluation across several categories, including firewall, identification, authentication and access, secure communications and embedded software,” Ledger noted. Accordingly, a lab deployed by ANSSI tested the Nano S and determined it to have superior security against various relevant attack vectors. The development makes Ledger the first known hardware wallet manufacturer to receive such government certification, a reality that the company will use to press its claim as being the industry’s de facto wallet leader in more than just sales. The French company also declared it would work to ascertain the First Level Security Certificate for its other devices beyond the Nano S, like the Blue and the Nano X.",

The regulators also say detailed guidelines concerning securities token offerings (STO) are being prepared. This news is the latest positive development concerning cryptocurrency regulation in Southeast Asia as the adoption of the emerging digital economy continues to take shape in the region  According to the Bangkok Post, the board of directors of the Thai SEC has approved the first-ever ICO portal in the country. Commenting on the development, Archari Suppiroj, the head of the Commission’s fintech division said that relevant government parastatals were in the process of finalizing approval for the ICO portal. Suppiroj did not provide the name of the approved ICO portal but said that it was being operated by a foreign-based company. According to Suppiroj, about eight companies applied to the SEC for approval to establish ICO portals in the country. ICO portals form part of the sweeping regulations introduced by Thailand in mid-2018. These portals provide a screening platform for ICOs, as well as verifying other compliance requirements such as know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, and smart contract source codes. The Thai SEC fintech chief also declared that the ICOs would soon take off in the country. Elaborating further, Suppiroj opined: Back in August 2019, as many as 50 ICO projects expressed interests in obtaining licenses from regulators to carry out their cryptocurrency fundraising campaigns. In May 2018, the country temporarily banned ICOs while it was in the process of creating a firm regulatory framework for the industry as a whole. According to Suppiroj the efforts of the SEC to regulate the ICO space has begun to bear dividends. Suppiroj declared that ICOs projects are pivoting away from projects with minimal utility to ICOs backed by physical assets like real estate. The Thai SEC is also reportedly looking at issuing regulatory guidelines for STOs. Back in February 2019, the country’s legislature approved an amendment to Thailand’s securities law to allow for STOs. Commenting on STO regulations in the country, Suppiroj declared: Suppiroj believes that once STO guidelines are adequately firmed up, issuers will be able to offer security tokens in the country’s primary market. With ICO season set to kick off in earnest in Thailand, potential investors will need to acquaint themselves with the regulatory and compliance measures initiated by the government. Recently, the Thai SEC updated its list of approved cryptocurrencies for ICOs and trading. As part of the update, the regulator banned Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic being used for ICOs or as base pairs in cryptocurrency trading. According to a statement from the Thai SEC, the removal of those three cryptocurrencies wasn’t indicative of the government placing a blanket ban on the respective virtual currencies. The Thai SEC at the time of the announcement also revealed that the move was not likely to have any negative impact on ICOs and trading. According to the Commission, ICOs were yet to take off and no local exchange platform used any of the delisted tokens as base pairs for trading on their platforms.",

        "passage": "Top Trump administration members — including President Trump himself — have recently been taking increasingly open stances against cryptocurrencies. A related thread has unfurled this week as the White House coordinated with various agencies to publish two advisories that, in part, highlighted how cryptocurrencies are sometimes used to facilitate narco-trafficking.  Of course, crypto proponents argue that skeptics of the technology over-magnify its use in illicit activities. So if leaders in the Trump administration like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin — who will “not be loaded up on bitcoin” in 10 years — want to generally discourage good and bad actors alike from using the tech, it’s in their interest to highlight these activities where they can. The new advisories didn’t center on cryptocurrencies, but rather on the various methods that Chinese and Mexican drug suppliers use to get Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the hands of U.S. buyers. To that end, one of the bulletins was for financial institutions and the other for “digital private sector platforms” like e-commerce sites. Specifically then, these documents come as the White House wants to help companies “in detecting and reporting related activity” regarding to illicit purchases of drugs like Fentanyl, which can be up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. The backdrop is the ongoing opioid addiction crisis in the U.S. “The epidemic is tearing away at the social and economic fabric of our communities, while [transnational crime organizations], international drug traffickers, money launderers, and other criminal actors profit off the misery of victims,” one of the advisories read. Among other payment rails, the White House said virtual currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, and Monero are sometimes used by U.S. citizens to buy these drugs from foreign suppliers via “clearnet” or “dark web” sites. “On these websites, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids can be purchased with Bitcoin or more traditionally-accepted payment methods,” the coordinating agencies said. That virtual currencies have been used in such transactions has been no secret across many fields since before the takedown of the Silk Road marketplace back in 2013. The growing and continued critical spotlight suggests the Trump administration doesn’t plan on sitting on its hands where possible when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Money of any kind can be used for bad or good deeds, and the current administration is certainly being proactive when it comes to addressing bad deeds done with virtual currency — something we haven’t seen before out of a U.S. presidency. The latest domino to drop in that regard came on August 21st, when the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklisted the cryptocurrency addresses of three Chinese citizens that the watchdog says were involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said the crackdown comes as a campaign is just beginning to bring a spotlight to new kinds of crime flows: To be sure, cryptocurrencies are interesting and notable for much more beyond crime. The fact that the Trump admin has been zooming in on that aspect while not simultaneously fostering innovation around the tech is telling. Why? Because the administration could be tough on crime while also fostering crypto innovation. But we’ve only seen the toughness to date.",

        "passage": "Venezuela has been in a disastrous state for several years. The country has fallen victim to mass inflation after its native currency, the bolivar, was deemed relatively worthless by the nation’s leading financial authorities. As a result, the prices of necessary survival goods such as food, clothing and water, have shot through the roof. Items like these are relatively inaccessible to many individuals who either don’t have the money or the resources to obtain what they need to keep their families up and healthy. In addition, many of these products are seemingly rare. It’s not improbable now to hear stories of citizens venturing into their local marketplaces to see all the shelves bare except for a single canned item that’s selling for a ridiculous price given the shortages the country is experiencing. We have often heard tales of residents killing zoo animals for food in a final and desperate attempt to survive. It’s an ugly picture, to say the least.  For many, the idea of cryptocurrency potentially easing the country’s financial troubles isn’t that far off, and to an extent, the nation has already ventured into this territory through its use of the petro. Introduced in early 2018, the currency is allegedly backed by the country’s many oil reserves, making it something of a “stable coin” in that oil will always be a necessary item for humanity’s ongoing survival. While not backed by fiat, oil is consistently proving itself as a much-needed resource, though the statement regarding the petro’s backing has led to controversy. No mention of the oil reserves occurs in the petro’s whitepaper, and many believe President Nicolas Maduro has embellished the currency’s abilities and uses. Due to the ongoing controversy, many exchanges do not feature petro trading on their platforms, and U.S. President Donald Trump has banned all petro trading in America. Some analysts now believe that the answer is not a separate cryptocurrency, but rather a cryptocurrency service; one that could potentially deliver financial aid to the people through cryptocurrency. The man taking this to heart is Steve Hanke, a hyperinflation expert and professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. He’s teaming up with Air TM in Mexico City and introducing a project entitled “Airdrop Venezuela.” The goal of the project is to garner roughly $1 million in cryptocurrency donation funds. That money will then be distributed to approximately 100,000 people via Air TM’s trading platform. Hanke states: It is believed that if Maduro were to tie the bolivar to the U.S. dollar, the inflation issue could be resolved in a relatively short time. Unfortunately, the Venezuelan president and his associates have failed to do so. Presently, inflation in Venezuela exceeds 116,000 percent. Hanke is confident that the project will demonstrate crypto’s ability to be used as a national, mainstream medium of exchange. He comments: If the experiment is successful, crypto could be used in everyday transactions, officiating its position as money and not just as a speculative investment tool. In addition, the successful distribution of the crypto donations could officially dollarize Venezuela, which could quickly stabilize the economy.",

However, he also believes it’s too early to say if this drop is short or long term: However, Ethereum bounced back in the hundreds the next day, hitting $113 up from $98 – a seven percent increase. Bitcoin went up six percent, and Ripple saw an eight percent increase as well. Interestingly, even as Bitcoin’s price fell, the overall volume of Satoshi’s cryptocurrency stayed within $5 to $6 million. Then, as it went back up above $4,000, that number reached $6.7 billion thanks to buy orders. Another analyst, Don Alt, asserted that Sunday’s crash was the fastest decline he had seen “in recent years.” Yet, Alt remains positive in that a recovery will likely happen sooner rather than later. Even with that, he says to be prepared in case of another crash. A new yearly low could hit at $2,950 – totaling an eighty-five percent drop from Bitcoin’s all-time high: However, we have to take our small victories where we can get them. Earlier today, The Next Web reported that Ohio would be the first U.S. state to accept Bitcoin for tax payments. Going into effect this week, business owners can pay their taxes on OhioCrypto.com. The website accepts twenty-three different forms of taxes, with the full list available here: We can thank Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel for this change. He believes that crypto will “make things easier for tax-payers but also establish Ohio’s status as a cryptocurrency trailblazer.” Mandel isn’t sure how many businesses will jump onto this initiative right away, but the treasurer is “confident that this cryptocurrency initiative will continue.” According to the website, all payments will be processed by BitPay. Eventually, this service will be open to people instead of just businesses. However, this marks the first time governments “have considered accepting payments in cryptocurrency,” says The Next Web. This account comes after a San Francisco judge had a criminal pay his bail in Bitcoin, but was later revoked as courts couldn’t figure out how it should work.",

        "passage": "The lure of making a fortune online can prove an irresistible proposition for even the most level-headed among us. It requires a strong constitution to watch those little green percentages rise higher and higher every day without throwing at least some of your money at them. Trading in cryptocurrency has become more widespread, and more concentrated in the past year, as the market skyrocketed towards the end of 2017.  And now we’re starting to see the side-effects of having an accessible, volatile, but possibly immensely profitable source of market speculation that even the average internet user can get involved in.  Occurrences of cryptocurrency addiction are becoming so widespread that the medical industry is now starting to take notice. Earlier this week, The Castle Craig Hospital in Scotland launched an initiative aimed at treating people who have become addicted to cryptocurrency trading.  Castlecraig Hospital in Scotland Chris Burn, the resident gambling therapist at Castle Craig, equated trading in cryptocurrencies to a form of gambling, he told news.com.au: Perhaps it’s the accessibility of cryptocurrency which makes it so dangerous. A quick glance as the NASDAQ market index is enough to discourage anyone from investing in stocks. However, the infrastructure for crypto trading is a lot more welcoming. First of all, it’s all just a click away at all times. Then you have easily found market statistics on sites like CoinMarketCap. At the same time there’s an internet subculture where fellow traders can unite and discuss their strategies on forums like BitcoinTalk and Reddit. Gambling therapist Burn proposed that crypto gambling follows the same patterns as any other type of gambling, and is used as an escape mechanism. He said: The Castle Craig clinic has released an in-depth guide on their website, where they pose ten questions to determine whether or not you may be addicted to cryptocurrency trading.  Cryptocurrency Addiction Questions, Image from Castlecraig If you answered ‘yes’ to just one of those questions, the clinicians say that this could be enough of a sign that you may need help. Giving three ‘yes’ answers is considered a clear sign of cryptocurrency addiction and you should seek medical help before your addiction gets out of control. Answering in the affirmative five times or more is classed as a sign that your crypto addiction has reached “pathological” levels, and you should seek help immediately. While Reddit might not be a dedicated psychological therapy website, sometimes its users do use it in that way. Cryptocurrency sub-reddits are filled with posters voicing concern about their trading addiction. One post was typical among the self-confessed addicts on the forum, it said: Another typical comment concerned how cryptocurrency seemed to take priority over other things in life: The vast majority of these posts have come in the last year, and it’s no coincidence why. There were almost no stories of cryptocurrency addiction prior to 2017 – ‘the year of cryptocurrency’. Online gambling has been around in some form for as long as the internet has existed. But just what is the difference between gambling and trading? Stock traders will say that the defining difference between trading stocks and cryptocurrency is that with stocks you actually gain a stake in a physical company, whereas with cryptocurrency you’re merely hoping that your coins might be worth something some day. However this is to neglect an important aspect about cryptocurrency – namely that many of the most profitable crypto platforms actually offer a real-world service, and often launch with a minimum viable product (MVP) already in place. In this sense, a typical stock market IPO is no different from an ICO. Investors choose the project which they think has market potential, and they back that project with their money in the hope of making a profit down the line. The gambling aspect is just as prevalent on the trading floor as it is on the crypto exchange. Companies rise and fall every day and there’s no sure-fire way of knowing which is going to be successful. There’s a reason why jumping out the top floor of their New York office building is not an uncommon way for stock speculators to meet their end. The Castle Craig addiction guide recommends direct medical treatment for cryptocurrency addiction, but if for some reason this is not an option for you then they recommend the following steps. Crypto addiction was always going to rear its ugly head, not least because 10-15% of the population naturally have what’s called an ‘addictive personality’, which makes them particularly susceptible to all forms of addiction. Likewise, the NHS states that 1 in 3 people in the U.K alone are addicted to some kind of substance or negative behavior. Crypto addiction will undoubtedly fuel another round of media furor targeted at the crypto industry and the problem can only increase as more people become involved in this new sector of finance. If you feel like you may be developing an addiction to cryptocurrency trading, please seek help from family, friends or a professional as soon as possible.",

        "passage": "Phony initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a big problem here and abroad. That’s why countries like the Bahamas are taking matters into their own hands and enforcing regulations to ensure they stop. Fraudulent ICOs have proven to be troublesome in both the United States and throughout the globe. While the ICO remains a popular and common tactic to obtain capital for new businesses, not all these ventures have honesty in their blueprints.  Many startups see ICOs as easy ways to garner funds quickly for their operations and employee wages, so they set up a fund in which investors can offer capital – usually in the form of ether or Ethereum-based tokens – in exchange for an entirely new coin, which they can then use to access the company’s goods and services. Though not all fall into this category, several of these startups seeking funding potentially disappear within months of the ICO, taking the money with them and leaving investors with less cash in their pockets. They stand with their pride broken, and all they have to their name is a coin that now serves no purpose in the investing world or beyond. It is estimated that approximately $500 million has been lost throughout 2018 alone to phony ICOs. That’s a very big number, and some countries are beginning to say, “no more.” One of those nations is the Bahamas. A cluster of islands in the middle of the Caribbean, the Bahamas is widely known as a tourist attraction, but has become a major cryptocurrency haven over the past year. One of the country’s biggest ventures involved releasing its own state-backed cryptocurrency. Now, it’s moving in a different direction by drafting one of the first official regulations built to battle phony ICOs. The document was created by the Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBOB), which says this will help the country as it prepares to integrate digital assets into its financial service offerings. CBOB believes that the cryptocurrency industry’s approach towards international regulation is “too fragmented,” which makes it difficult to handle or manage the emerging risks. Among the additional amendments in the regulatory framework include those designed to battle crimes like tax evasion and money laundering along with market volatility, one of the biggest problems plaguing the cryptocurrency space. The document is being molded based on recent suggestions made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). CBOB later stated: The country is working hard to build its reputation as a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain hub through its latest partnership with Cuba Ventures Corp. Blockchain Revolupay. The startup has decided that the Bahamas will be the center of its headquarters thanks to its solid IT infrastructure. The company announced last year that it would be setting up camp in the Caribbean state, and described the facility it was using to reporters:",

        "passage": "It seems that 2019 is already shaping up to be a solid year for the cryptocurrency industry. Sources tell Bloomberg that one of the world’s largest asset managers will soon offer Bitcoin (BTC) trading to its tens of thousands of institutional clients, setting the stage for a large capital inflow into digital assets.  In late-October of 2018, Fidelity Investments, a Boston-based financial services provider, revealed that it would be launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS) — a branch focused solely on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. And since the announcement, stakeholders the industry over have waited eagerly for FDAS’ inaugural day in operation. But during the months that followed, headlines around the Fidelity subsidiary slowed, and some cynics speculated that it was nothing but a marketing ploy. However, this changed with hearsay in February. As reported by Blockonomi, insiders told Bloomberg that FDAS’ first product, a fully-fledged Bitcoin custody solution, was slated to launch in March if final testing turned out well. As the branch’s chief, Tom Jessop, told reporters later, the rumor was true, confirming that Fidelity was securing BTC for its clients. Yet the company will soon branch out from being a cryptocurrency custodian. New reports, namely one from Bloomberg posted Monday, divulge that the option to conduct cryptocurrency purchases and sales will soon be available on FDAS. Those familiar with the matter told the outlet that “within a few weeks,” the institutional clientele will have access to the aforementioned solution. It isn’t clear if Fidelity will be offering spot market trading or some darkpool/over-the-counter (OTC) solution to its clients. Yet, as explained by a company representative, the service will be “focused on Bitcoin.” She further adds: This news comes just days after Fidelity unveiled an institutional survey they commissioned, which revealed that institutions are widely amicable towards the digital asset class. Out of the “more than 400 U.S. institutional investors” polled, 47% agreed that cryptocurrencies should have a place in their portfolios. Out of that pro-crypto group, which included pensions, family offices, crypto funds, and endowments, 72% noted that they would be most comfortable with holding digital asset funds, like the array of proposed Bitcoin ETFs and Grayscale’s GBTC. On the matter of why a cryptocurrency allocation is logical, the institutions among the 47% noted that they see cryptocurrencies as innovative technology and an asset class barely correlated with traditional markets (asymmetrical risk) and has “appealing characteristics”.  No matter of FDAS’ launch goes well or not, all this goes to show that the American financial giant is committed to cryptocurrency. Ari Paul, the founder & chief investment officer of BlockTower Capital, would agree with this cheery sentiment. In a tweet posted in late-March, Paul, who (in)famously made a $1 million bet that BTC was going to surmount $50,000 by 2018’s end, notes that there are “hundreds of passionate advocates” for cryptocurrency at Fidelity, from the C-suite to the lower rungs of the executive ladder. In fact, Paul states that in 2015, the chief executive of the institution herself, the esteemed Abigail Johnson, was personally mining Bitcoin, right in her lofty office. He adds that there are more crypto-focused staffers at Fidelity than the “five biggest industry funds combined.”  This might not be hearsay either. In an episode of “Unconfirmed” with industry journalist Laura Shin, Jessop stated that his company has an R&D branch that has eyed cryptocurrencies since 2013-2014. He even quips that once upon a time, the company even had an internal pilot that allowed employees to purchase food for Bitcoin, underscoring Fidelity’s long-standing support for what many traditional economists have deemed the devil’s spawn. It is as clear as day that Fidelity doesn’t intend to slow its foray into cryptocurrency anytime soon, that’s for sure.",

        "passage": "The first Binance stablecoin is coming, and the token just got a clean bill of health from smart contract security startup Quantstamp. On July 18th, the Y Combinator-backed auditors announced they had finished reviewing the code of the pound sterling stablecoin, dubbed Binance GBP (BGBP) by the powerhouse Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange.  As part of the audit, Quantstamp’s experts checked the token’s code against the ERC20 token standard and combed for security flaws and any other problematic issues. The team’s work led to Binance updating their ERC20 libraries through OpenZeppelin and removing other miscellaneous “low risk issues.” Binance, nimble navigators of global regulatory arbitrage, are pushing ahead on the stablecoin against the almost poetic backdrop of Facebook blockchain head David Marcus having faced calls for a Libra development moratorium in U.S. congressional oversight hearings this week. Of course, BGBP will simply be pegged 1:1 with the pound, whereas Libra is being more ambitiously devised like a Big Tech-backed non-sovereign central bank currency. (Note: Binance has considered attempting to join the Libra Association, per company chief strategy officer Gin Chao). The BGBP won’t be too simple though, as the token is set to be released both on Ethereum and the exchange’s in-house blockchcain, Binance Chain, Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao said on the news: The stablecoin comes after CEO Zhao confirmed during a YouTube “Ask Me Anything” back in May that the exchange was exploring launching its own stablecoins. Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma hailed the BGBP audit as just the latest sign of the startup’s rising prominence in the cryptoeconomy: In recent months, the fledgling play has made a name for itself in reviewing the smart contracts of high-profile industry stakeholders like eToro and Prysmatic Labs, and in doing so has “secured over a billion dollars of digital asset value,” the company has said. In June, the startup launched the Quantstamp Security Network V2 on the Ethereum mainnet. With the activation, users can leverage the network scan and store smart contract vulnerability reports on the Ethereum blockchain. The update also made it possible for community members to run a Quantstamp node to earn the network’s native token, QSP. The Malta-based exchange is taking a blitzkrieg approach to asserting itself as the cryptoeconomy’s leading service provider. This month alone, Binance has burned $24 million worth of its BNB tokens, opened up a margin trading platform, announced plans for a cryptocurrency futures service, and turned two years old. On the margin trading launch, CEO Zhao noted the company was gunning to become the most useful exchange brand for cryptocurrency users of all stripes: Notably, the exchange also recently confirmed that it was looking to open up a new America-based operation, Binance US.",

        "passage": "Kunal Barchha, co-founder of CoinRecoil — an Indian Bitcoin exchange platform has lambasted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the country’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies. India continues to double down on its anti-crypto leanings with reports of an impending blanket ban. Meanwhile, more exchanges are leaving the country due to lack of access to banking services.  In an open letter to Prime Minister Modi, Barchha stated that the country’s central bank approach to the cryptocurrency sector was killing the industry in India, as the government wasn’t forthcoming with regulatory policies regarding cryptocurrency. An excerpt from the letter reads: There is a deafening silence on the future of crypto industry with regard to regulations, and this kills the dreams of budding entrepreneurs like us. I do understand the government’s concern over the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, and their possible use for money laundering or terrorist financing. In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prohibited commercial banks from providing services to persons or business involved in cryptocurrency trading or dealing with virtual coins. The ban comes after the apex bank repeatedly warned citizens about the risks involved with trading or dealing with virtual currencies. RBI’s announcement meant that crypto exchanges in the country would soon be out of business, as users needed banks to be able to carry out a transfer from their savings accounts to wallets. Subsequently, customers would have to use peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange platforms like LocalBitcoins and Bisq to trade virtual currencies. Consequently, several exchanges and the cryptocurrency community in India challenged the central bank’s decision in court. A case that has seen lots of back and forth in more than one year. However, in February 2019, Blockonomi reported that India’s Supreme Court gave the Indian government four weeks to come up with a defined regulatory policy regarding cryptocurrencies. Failure to come up with a policy within the stated time frame would mean that the apex court would deliver its judgment. The RBI ban in 2018 had its toll on crypto exchanges, including Kunal Barchha’s. In the letter, the CoinRecoil chief stated that the company tried to challenge the central bank’s directive through legal means. Barchha further stated that the startup was doing just fine until the government’s policies threw a spanner in their works. According to Barchha, the legal proceedings have put a dent in the company’s finances. CoinRecoil is one of many Bitcoin exchanges negatively affected by the RBI ban. In 2018, Zebpay, the largest virtual currency exchange in India at the time, closed cryptocurrency activities in India and moved to Malta. The company also expanded its services to Australia in May 2019. Another India-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinme, packed up and left the country, in the face uncertain regulatory policies. More recently, the RBI ban forced Koinex to also shutdown cryptocurrency services in India, joining the list of Indian exchanges leaving the country. According to the CoinRecoil co-founder, the government was carrying out decisions regarding the industry without researching or liaising with stakeholders in the industry. Buttressing the above point, Kunal Barchha said: “In the RTI filed last year, it was revealed that RBI didn’t do any sort of research before issuing the circular. Nearly 3 million people were utterly bereft of their money by that one piece of paper. Few of the government officials commented that the Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitely repeatedly warn about its usage. Also, RBI cautioned the users about it.” Barchha added that the government was dependent on decisions made by foreign regulatory agencies, instead of discussing with its citizens regarding the crypto space. However, Barchha stated that the solution to the government’s problems was the need to be open-minded with crypto stakeholders, as rigidity wouldn’t work. Furthermore, the co-founder stated that crypto exchanges in the country are willing to ensure that their platforms aren’t used for money laundering purposes. Also, adequate support from the government would mean that crypto startups in the country would device better ways to reduce the government’s tension.",

        "passage": "On May 15, the World Bank published a press release which stated that it had partnered with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) to enable blockchain-based secondary market bond recording. The secondary trading project was performed on the Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument (bond-i), a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. It was reportedly developed by CommBank’s Blockchain Centre of Excellence at the CommBank’s Innovation Lab in Sydney as part of the global banking institutions mission to explore and build on the potential of distributed ledgers.  Just last year, the World Bank issued the bond-i, claiming that it was created, allocated, and managed with the use of blockchain technology. At the time, CommBank was the sole arranger of the bond. It ended up making the World Bank a staggering AUD 110 million ($81 million), thanks to the contribution of investors such as financial services company Northern Trust Bank, the New South Wales (NSW) Treasury Corporation, and QBE Insurance Group Limited, Australia’s largest global insurer. The press release at the time, stated that the World Bank made $50 – $60 billion in yearly bond issuances every year in its bid to improve global market sustainability and mitigate poverty. The bond was further described as a milestone that would help put them in a much better position to advise countries on the risks and opportunities of disruptive technologies, especially concerning the institution’s Sustainable Development Goals. The World Bank sees the bond as the first step in the process of moving bond transactions from manual procedures to faster and quicker automated ones. Per the recent release, the World Bank declared that since bond-i was launched, both the project and the Bank have gotten support from numerous players within the global financial and technology sector. Sophie Gilder, Head of Experimentation & Commercialization, at the CommBank’s Innovation Labs, said, “There is a growing recognition that blockchain technology can deliver a superior digital market for raising capital and then managing and trading securities, so we are working with our strategic partners to realize that vision. Blockchain has the potential to streamline processes for raising capital and trading securities, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance regulatory oversight.” The World Bank does seem to be heavily invested in pursuing a deeper understanding of blockchain technology. Earlier this year, a report published on The Financial Times revealed that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had come together to launch a private blockchain network as a means of studying the technology and its potential. In addition to the private blockchain, both institutions were also alleged to have developed an asset, and while it wasn’t called a cryptocurrency, it sure looked and functioned like one. The report called the asset a “Learning Coin,” and claimed that it was based on their joint blockchain network. However, while it seemed like a cryptocurrency, the report maintained that it was fundamentally different. For one, the asset isn’t tied to any known fiat currency, and it doesn’t have any monetary value. It was reported to only be intended for use within the World Bank and the IMF as a tool for their staff to help uncover more about blockchain technology, with an emphasis placed on its underlying feature with digital assets. As such, the con and all its properties would only be accessible to World Bank and IMF staff. Both institutions were also said to have developed an app to help accompany the use of the Learning Coin. It was reported to be a research-assisting tool, which would help provide and develop learning apparatus like videos, research papers, and presentations.",

        "passage": "A group of large banks are investing $50 million USD into a financial settlements system built atop blockchain technology, the latest in a string of blockchain-centric headlines coming out of the mainstream banking industry this year. That revelation comes via Reuters, which was told by an anonymous source close to the situation that approximately 12 banks were collectively investing into Fnality, a startup taking the reins on the so-called utility settlement coin (USC) project first outlined by London tech play Clearmatics and Swiss banking power UBS Group AG four years ago. It’s not presently known which institutions are joining forces behind Fnality, though likely investors include the world-leading banks that have joined UBS’s blockchain settlements initiative in the past, namely Barclays, BNY Mellon, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MUFG, and Santander.  The USC system, which the anonymous source said might be released in 2020, would involve digitizing major fiat currencies and thereafter using these tokenized versions on a blockchain settlements rail. The idea would be to bring greater speed and transparency to interbank payments. The advancement comes as others in mainstream finance are still skeptical toward blockchain. A few weeks ago, Cathy Bessant, the tech and operations chief at Bank of America, said she was still “bearish” on the tech: With that said, if projects like the USC effort really do launch in the coming months, then Bessant and her peers at Bank of America really will have something to trial. Another major wrinkle in the blockchain payments arena came earlier this year, when the leadership at banking giant JP Morgan confirmed it was working to activate settlement functionalities on its blockchain payments rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN). The IIN, which is built atop JP Morgan’s in-house private fork of Ethereum, Quorum, already boasts more than 200 participating banks and institutions to date. So why the pivot to settlements now? Last month, Morgan’s head of global clearing John Hunter said the shift would address optimizing bank processing flows, which have hitherto proven slow, manual, paper-intensive, and prone to compliance errors. Via the IIN, the bank is hoping to offer real-time validation that transactions are, in fact, accurate. Furthermore, the IIN will reportedly work in tanden with JPM Coin, the stablecoin-like token currently being built on Quorum. With Quorum just having been launched as the first supported blockchain on Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service, JP Morgan is angling for further major institutions to build out their own blockchain solutions. In related news, software consortium R3 announced earlier this month that a group of major banks had finished up trialing Voltron, a financial app that uses R3’s Corda distributed ledger as its foundation. Specifically, Voltron was aimed at optimizing the process around enterprise Letter of Credit transactions. 50 institutional participants from over 25 countries joined in on the project, with banking heavyweights like Alfa Bank, ING, and Societe Generale having tested the app during the pilot period. In their follow-up announcement, R3 said the trial had proven to be a strong success: So with Fnality, IIN, and Voltron now in play, it’s clear that some of the world’s biggest banks think blockchain tech has serious potential.",

        "passage": "Enjin is teaming up with Japanese accelerator HashPort and will work to promote adoption of Enjin’s blockchain solutions in the Japanese market. HashPort will act as a business development agent for Enjin, which is developing an ecosystem of blockchain-based products and services for gaming, which are fuelled by a cryptocurrency. Japan is a massive market for gaming. It is estimated to be the third-largest market for games and has a population of more than 125 million people, making the country a perfect fit for Enjin’s blockchain game development platform.  Unlike many nations, Japan is also very open to using cryptocurrencies and has an existing base for crypto exchanges, as well as gaming. In addition to helping connect Enjin with potential adopters of the Enjin Platform, HashPort will also look to build business relationships and assist with getting Enjin Coin (ENJ) listed on Japanese exchanges. In addition to having a huge population of video game enthusiasts, Japan is one of the biggest forces in the global gaming community. When a popular product emerges in the Japanese gaming market, it could very well be on its way to taking the world by storm. From the original Nintendo console system to Pokémon GO, the game designs that Japan creates have been an extraordinary influence on global culture for decades. That trend is set to continue, and blockchain stands to play a major role in the next chapter of gaming history. Enjin is getting into a lot more than a new customer base with its entry to Japan. In fact, it could help to embed the ERC-1155 token into the global gaming market, as every asset minted with the Enjin Platform is an ERC-1155 token backed by Enjin Coin. Created by Enjin CTO alongside a community of Github developers, ERC-1155 recently reached final status and was adopted by the Ethereum community as the accepted standard for minting fungible and non-fungible assets. One of the biggest advantages of ERC-1155 is that it allows developers to mint an unlimited number of both fungible (identical) and non-fungible (unique) assets in a single smart contract. ERC-1155 tokens are also powerful in that they can be used across numerous games and platforms (which Enjin refers to as the “Multiverse”) while maintaining unique qualities. Enjin is working to launch the Enjin Platform to Ethereum Mainnet. After the launch, more than 25 million software developers from around the world will be able to use Enjin Coin to mint ERC-1155 tokens and integrate them into whatever they choose. If Japanese game developers are able to popularize the use of ERC-1155 tokens in the domestic market, a greater presence in the global gaming market could follow. Big game developers have been resistant to allowing the use of unique items that exist in a decentralized way, as it removes their ability to control the game environment. Gamers win big when they have ownership and control over their digital stash, and that could be the next big step in gaming. HashPort Accelerator Founder Seihaku Yoshida commented that: Yoshida appears to understand that blockchain creates huge opportunities for game developers who are open to its adoption and may also create competitive advantages for the Japanese gaming industry, as its developers work to adopt a technology that developers in other countries have not yet caught on to. The use of unique tokens represents a major shift in how digital property is owned. It won’t take gamers long to figure out that it is much better to actually own your items, than trust a company with all of your digital goods. Earlier this year, Enjin launched its Testnet version of its blockchain game development platform, and it has already attracted more than 7,000 users. The platform that allows people to create, manage, and integrate ERC-1155 tokens into their games, apps, and websites, while empowering users with true ownership of their unique digital tokens. The gaming market is a perfect place for ERC-1155 blockchain assets to gain more traction, and Enjin is likely making a good move by entering the Japanese market with the help of HashPort. ERC-1155 tokens have applications that extend well beyond gaming, so it will be interesting to see what happens over the next year or two as Japanese developers begin adopting the Enjin Platform. There is a growing need for decentralized options in the gaming space, and it appears that Enjin is securing a place for itself in one of the best places for development globally.",

        "passage": "Ripple is adding two new entities; UAE Exchange and Unimoni to its global payments network. This move comes as the blockchain firm continues to challenge SWIFT and other mainstream players in the international payment scene.  UAE-based Finablr, the parent company of both UAE Exchange and Unimoni announced the news via a press release published on Sunday (February 10, 2019). According to the statement, both companies will go live on RippleNet to enable their respective customers to enjoy blockchain-based cross-border remittance services. As part of the move, both companies will first partner with Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. Consequently, the launch of the service will see UAE Exchange and Unimoni users able to send money to people in Thailand via the RippleNet network. Speaking on the partnership, Navin Gupta, the head of Ripple’s South Asia and MENA region said: Thailand like other places in Southeast Asia is becoming a hub for cryptocurrency adoption, especially in the payments arena. The high fees charged by global remittance service providers appear to be pushing many to adopt the use of virtual currencies in the region. According to World Bank figures, remittance inflows to Southeast Asia grew by 13.5 percent in 2018. Reports indicate that a significant portion of that figure comes from Southeast Asian natives working as expats in the UAE and other countries in the Middle East. Earlier in the year, Indonesian unicorn firm, Go-Jek, acquired Coins.ph one of the largest Bitcoin payment platforms in Southeast Asia. The acquisition forms part of a larger move by Go-Jek to adopt cryptocurrency payments on all of its service platforms. This partnership with UAE Exchange and Unimoni forms part of a much larger goal for Ripple and its plans of establishing itself as a significant player in the global payments ecosystem. To this end, the company identifies SWIFT, the current cross-border payments behemoth as its primary competition. Back in January, SWIFT effectively snubbed Ripple, choosing instead to partner with R3, another blockchain-based startup. The move sees SWIFT working to utilize R3’s legacy trade finance platform within its own operating protocols. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to strike partnerships with Banks and financial institutions around the world. In October 2018, Ripple launched xRapid that utilizes the XRP cryptocurrency in international payments. These mainstream adoption developments, are yet to have a significant impact on the price of XRP. Like the rest of the market, XRP also suffered a dismal 2018 based on overall price performance. XRP declined by more than 90 percent in 2018. The news of the Ripple partnership with UAE Exchange and Unimoni is also another indication of the growing cryptocurrency adoption in the UAE. At the start of the year, the country in collaboration with Saudi Arabia agreed to create a joint cryptocurrency for both countries. The move forms part of plans to foster greater cooperation between the two Middle Eastern neighbors. Reports indicate that preliminary use-case for the joint cryptocurrency will focus on banks as a means of understanding the intricacies of a unitary digital currency for both countries. In 2018, Blockonomi reported that securities regulators in the UAE were planning to create regulations for ICOs in the country. According to the report, the rules aim at legitimizing ICOs as part of the nation’s capital market.",

In a surprising twist of events that has left a large part of the crypto community in shock, Bitcoin.com became a victim of a cyber attack. And while major websites such as Bitcoin.com aren’t new to hacks, what makes this newsworthy is the fact that the attack was government-sponsored. According to Roger Ver, who goes by the username – MemoryDealers on Reddit,  one of the most vocal supporters of Bitcoin Cash and founder of Bitcoin.com, anonymous government-backed hackers were attempting to compromise one of the Bitcoin.com’s email accounts.  Ver received a Google Suite alert about a potential intrusion into one of his emails on Feb. 28. “Because Bitcoin.com is building tools to bring economic freedom to the world, we are likely under government-backed attacks,” he wrote alongside the screenshot of the alert on Reddit. Google Suite accounts began receiving alerts about government-sponsored cyber attacks back in 2017 after Google updated its security protocols. The service is able to identify malware-loaded emails, phishing attempts, or brute force attacks carried out from government-linked cyber espionage associations, known as Advanced Persistent Threats. According to Google, if such an attack is successful, it could lead attackers to all of Bitcoin.com’s data at once. This may include emails, docs, spreadsheets, sites, presentations, and cloud-enabled file backups. Eric Grosse, the vice president of security engineering at Google, said that seeing an alert about a government-sponsored attack doesn’t mean that hackers have managed to gain access to the website or any of the users’ accounts. However, it means that the website and the associated accounts are a target and that they must take steps to improve their security. Despite the fact that Google doesn’t reveal their criteria for what constitutes a “government-backed attack,” many crypto enthusiasts have seconded Ver about the possibilities of a big government such as China being behind the attack. A Reddit user pointed out that Google has a very weak track record when it comes to “calling out the U.S. government,” which could mean that there was another government involved. It still remains unclear who attacked Bitcoin.com – it could take several weeks, or even months before the public sees a new development in the case. What remains certain is the fact that crypto businesses and websites have become the go-to target for cybercriminals in the past few years.",

        "passage": "Mainstream payments titan Mastercard continues to make notable forays into the blockchain space. The latest embrace was announced on September 11th, when the company unveiled it had entered into a strategic partnership with the enterprise blockchain consortium R3, the backers of the open-source Corda blockchain project. Namely, the collaboration will see the two organizations “pilot a new blockchain-enabled cross-border payments solution” for “connecting global faster payments infrastructures, schemes and banks supported by a clearing and settlement network operated by Mastercard.”  The meld is about staying at the tip of the spear of global payments said Peter Klein, Mastercard’s executive vice president of New Payment Platforms: The news comes after several major blockchain-centric job openings appeared on Mastercard’s in-house jobs tracker portal last month. Positions being sought included “Blockchain Solutions Architect” and “Director, Cryptocoin/Wallet Product Management.” Those postings indicated the company was preparing to ramp up its blockchain activities further, so the R3 partnership appears to be just the first of many related activities to come as Mastercard continues to dive deeper into the blockchain ecosystem. Of course, Mastercard also made waves back in June when Facebook revealed that the company was among the first 29 organizations that had agreed to join the Libra Association, the governing body that will administer Facebook’s proposed Libra stablecoin cryptocurrency. And while rumors have recently swirled that some of those organizations have considered backing out of the project, Mastercard has offered no indication yet that it’s among the lot whose interest has waned. With the Mastercard-R3 meld as just the latest example, there’s been lots of movement in recent months regarding large players exploring blockchain tech for efficiently facilitating international payments. For example, in July news broke that Japanese authorities were considering whether to create a cross-border network for cryptocurrency payments, not unlike SWIFT for mainstream banking payments. One month before that, Mastercard competitor VISA announced the Visa B2B Connect network, which was built atop the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and designed to help enterprises make inexpensive international transfers. In the spring, a dozen large banks collectively invested $50 million USD into Fnality, a startup focused on using the utility settlement coin (USC) in interbank payments. And not long before that, American banking giant J.P. Morgan revealed its JPM Coin, which is likely to be used within the bank’s interbank blockchain rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN). Taken altogether, these developments bode for some serious competition to Ripple, the backers of the XRP cryptocurrency — a cryptocurrency whose main use case is commonly said to be cross-border payments. The firm is undoubtedly feeling the pressure, or at least to will the keep fighting for its position near the front of the cryptoeconomy’s pack considering XRP is currently the third largest cryptocurrency according to market capitalization. Last month, Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said the company was exploring a series of acquisitions and investments to help improve its position. “We’re in a very strong position, our business is growing strongly, we have a strong balance sheet, and I intend to press our advantage,” Garlinghouse said. Accordingly, Garlinghouse and his associates will need to move such intentions into fruition to stay ahead of its like-minded competitors.",

        "passage": "Brian Kelly of BKCM LLC believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is to break new grounds as it begins another bullish phase. BTC – the top-ranked cryptocurrency is up more than 40 percent since the start of 2019. Despite a couple of price pullbacks, Bitcoin has stayed above the $5,000 price level leading many to speculate that BTC is in a bullish cycle. Several analysts and commentators forecast a positive run for Bitcoin with some expecting BTC to reach a new all-time high (ATH).  Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday (April 10, 2019) Kelly declared that the fall to $3,100 in December 2018 marked a new long-term low for Bitcoin. After trading sideways between the Summer and Fall of 2018, BTC crashed in mid-November amid a bitter civil war in the Bitcoin Cash arena.  The strain from the Bitcoin Cash hash war saw BTC fundamentals take a nosedive leading to a reduction in the confidence of many in the market. The result, the BTC price careened from $6,000 to $3,100. Commenting on the matter, Kelly said: Kelly’s based his assertions about the coming Bitcoin resurgence on the emergence of favorable technical and market fundamentals. Earlier in the year, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors declared that many of the negative market conditions of 2018 had flipped to the positive side. The BKCM chief espoused the same position mentioning the imminent arrival of important institutional developments like the Fidelity custody platform. There is also a marked increase in institutional capital flowing into the BTC market. Recent data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed that there was a massive spike in long BTC futures contracts leading up to the April 2019 surge. The CME Bitcoin futures platform recorded an 88 percent increase in long BTC bets on April 2, 2019. According to Kelly: On the retail side, the Kimchi Premium in South Korea is also beginning to reappear. The BTC markup in the South Korean market is a major indicator of bullish sentiment. Recent reports also indicate that Chinese traders are also paying a premium to purchase BTC. On the technical fundamental side, the story is also similar. According to Kelly, active BTC wallet addresses has increased by more than 26 percent since the start of 2018. Also, the transaction volume of the BTC blockchain is back to 2017 highs. Veteran trader and analyst, Peter Brandt earlier in April predicted that BTC was entering a parabolic phase. Brandt accurately forecasted the 80 percent price drop of 2018. Kelly expressed a similar sentiment saying that Bitcoin would reach a new ATH during this new bull cycle. Bitcoin’s current ATH stands at $19,500 set in mid-December 2017.  Kelly’s timeline covers a two-year period with the Bitcoin halving in between. According to the BKCM chief, BTC’s cycle is usually a year before to year after the halving event – when the block reward for miners gets reduced by 50 percent. However, Kelly does add that such a bullish run is contingent on the institutional side of things kicking off. Projects like the Fidelity custody platform and the Bakkt physical-BTC futures contract will likely come online in 2019.",

        "passage": "According to a published blog post on its official site, Ledger, one of the most popular cryptocurrency hardware wallets in the world, has announced the launch of Ledger Live, its new mobile app. Ledger Live was designed to help serve as a mobile companion to the new Ledger Nano X hardware wallet, and it can also be used to provide secure management for the cryptocurrencies that are integrated with Ledger. Users will be able to manage their portfolios using the app regardless of their location or whether or not they have their Ledger wallets with them.  Ledger Live is now available on iOS and Android devices. The app reportedly comes with a wide array of nifty features, including the ability to easily configure the hardware wallet. Users can also check the authenticity of the device and import accounts from the desktop version of the Ledger Live. The app comes with increased levels for security, including Touch ID, Face ID, and password protection. Also, the Ledger Live provides support for over 1,000 digital assets, which can easily be stored on the platform. With the app, users can manage their balance, check their transaction history, get quick and easy reviews of their account history, make transfers with their account, and much more. Meanwhile, users of Ledger Blue and Ledger Nano S will be able to make use of Ledger Live or their devices as well, albeit to a limited level. Android users will be able to use the app for effecting transactions, as long as they have an OTG cable. However, iOS users don’t have this feature just yet.  The new Ledger Nano X is the latest product from Ledger which features bluetooth connectivity and is available for pre-order now, with shipping due in March 2019. We have obtained a copy of the new wallet from ledger for purposes of a review which we are carrying out at the moment. Ledger seems to be focusing on security after the blowback that came from researchers who claimed to have hacked into the Ledger Nano S, the Ledger Blue and the Trezor One at the 35C3 Conference. During the 35C3 Refreshing Memories Conference, the researchers showed that they were able to get the private key of a Trezor One hardware wallet by flashing its custom firmware. They also claimed that they were able to install any firmware on a Ledger Nano S. A member of the team claimed, “We can send malicious transactions to the ST31 [the secure chip] and even confirm it ourselves [via software,], or we can even go and show a different transaction [not the one that is actually being sent] on the screen.” Considering the Ledger Blue, a hardware wallet that comes with a color touchscreen, the researchers claimed that they were able to transport signals to the screen via a long trace on the motherboard, so that the hardware leaked the signals as radio waves. When a USB cable is connected to the wallet, the leaked signals become strong enough that they could easily be received through various meters. Still, Ledger responded to the claims made by the researchers at the conference, where it stressed that the perceived security vulnerabilities didn’t pose any threats to the wallet’s security, chastising the researchers for not going through the appropriate channels. “Ledger values all attempts to compromise our hardware wallets. We strongly believe that our Bounty program is the way towards continuous security improvements,” Ledger had explained in the post.",

        "passage": "The address of an Ethereum smart contract linked to a mysterious and apparently scammy project dubbed My Gold Coin (MGC) appears to be clogging the Ethereum network. Per the ETH Gas Station tracker site, on July 24th the median gas price to execute an Ethereum transaction was 20 gwei — a higher than usual average that indicated Ethereum was experiencing an acute usage spike.  According to the Gitcoin Gas Guzzlers page, the main culprit for the intraday surge of transactions was the MGC token contract, which can be found at 0x174BfA6600Bf90C885c7c01C7031389ed1461Ab9. Blockchain analytics site Bloxy notes that address was first created in January 2019, having facilitated a whopping eight million transactions since then, many having been airdrops of MGC. The address conducted 330,000 transactions involving MGC on July 24th alone. That’s a vast amount of activity for an utterly obscure project. As EthHub co-founder Gnosis team member Eric Conner highlighted in the tweet above, the inordinate amount of transfers means the project has already spent a small trove on gas fees with little apparent benefit. The last time Ethereum gas prices seriously spiked was mid-July, when the MGC contract was in the middle of another sudden spate of activity. The token’s address spent nearly $100,000 USD in gas fees on July 16th. As recently as July 22nd, the standard gas price on Ethereum was as low as 1 gwei per ETH Gas Station, indicating the recent activity hasn’t been constant.  So what’s clear is the backers of the MGC token are the ones mainly to blame for the current congestion on the Ethereum network. What isn’t clear exactly is what’s going on behind the scenes. However, from what little information is already available, it appears the token and its flurry of transactions are nefarious and not mundane in nature. The More Gold Coin project is seemingly a scam. There are currently several web entities linked to MGC, including an English language site at mgctoken.io, a Chinese language site at mgctoken.org, and a purportedly “official” Twitter account that features both English and Chinese. It’s not clear what connection the .io and .org sites have to each other, e.g. if one is ripped off from the next or if they have the same backers. Notably, Ethereum wallet extension MetaMask flags the .org site and another associated .biz site as being on a domain warning list for phishing scams.  “MGC Token creates a decentralized digital asset wallet with unique technological innovation,” the English landing page explains. That may read as empty hoopla, but not as figuratively empty as the Chinese page’s supposed team members, which all appear to be outright fake identities. Strange videos of these purported team members reading monotonously from MGC-centric scripts have been published on YouTube since the spring. One such video had less than 10 views at press time. Some have already directly called out the project. “It is an airdrop advertisement of a scam wallet that asks you to enter a private key to claim your reward,” TokenMarket chief technical officer Mikko Ohtamaa asserted on July 17th in a tweet that was tagged in Eric Conner’s aforementioned Wednesday thread. In a separate thread from last week, web developer Harry Denley tested the MGC application package, noting “we can confirm they were sending inputted mnemonics to their backend (which is a big no-no).”  Using that technique, the project is alleged to have already stolen more than 33,000 ether.",

        "passage": "Whilst it is often said that the vast bulk of consumer interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is based on speculative financial gain, it is always refreshing to see its usage considered for the greater cause. This is exactly what innovators at IBM are hoping to achieve, with a recent pilot test to ascertain whether blockchain and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies can help track groundwater usage in the U.S. state of California.  In collaboration with not-for-profit organization the Freshwater Trust and satellite sensor provider SweetSense, the IBM project is looking to tackle unsustainable usage of groundwater. The key reason that California has been targeted is that the location hosts one of the most at-risk aquifers in the U.S. In effect, the idea behind the project is to utilize IoT sensors to transmit groundwater usage levels in real-time. In order to obtain the data seamlessly and securely, the IoT sensors will transfer the data to the underlying IBM blockchain system. As such, the data is immutable to error, amendment or malpractice. The team at IBM are also hoping to utilize smart contract technology, which will allow the system to execute data when certain pre-defined if/when conditions are met. Specifically, the project will extract data from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, which covers in the region of 1,100 square miles. It is also important to note that the river is home to a significant quantity of animal and plant species, including legally protected fish. The IBM-backed partnership has also indicated that they plan to integrate a central dashboard that will allow a range of stakeholders – notably regulatory bodies, financiers and farmers, to access the real-time groundwater data. Further down the line, if the project is a success, the technology may be used to utilize the buying and selling of groundwater shares. This will essentially allow regulatory bodies to encourage sustainable groundwater usage levels. For example, should a stakeholder purchase groundwater shares, but subsequently use more levels than their shares enables, they can simply purchase more shares from other stakeholders who have a surplus supply. Nathan Wangusi of IBM Research Africa explains that the concept being trialed in California could potentially make the transition over to African-based farmers. In what Wangusi refers to as ‘Groundwater Credit’, the researcher added the technology will enable farmers to trade water sources on a peer-to-peer basis.  Moreover, the IBM researcher was also quoted as saying “The blockchain allows for visibility of water extraction and keeps a tight ledger on this, while helping with transparency and the ability to trade assets.” Whilst the aforementioned pilot test is certainly admirable, this isn’t the first time that IBM have created initiatives to make the world a better place. In September last year, we reported that IBM was driving an innovative program to trace contamination along the food supply chain. It was noted that leading U.S. based supermarket chain Walmart would be integrating the technology in to their systems. The program dictates that leafy-green vegetable providers that plan to sell their goods to Walmart must use the IBM-backed blockchain tracking platform. Furthermore, at the turn of 2019 it was announced that IBM would be piloting a blockchain project to ensure that Cobalt is sourced in an ethical manner. Cobalt is a highly demanded mineral that is used to power mobile phones, laptops and other electrical device. By utilizing blockchain technology, the IBM project hopes to trace and validate Cobalt purchases along the supply chain.",

        "passage": "Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has become public infrastructure. And like the genesis blockchain, Ethereum doesn’t have privacy measures baked into its first layer. But if Ethereum is to become a better and more universally practical public blockchain, it will need improved privacy so that users — individuals, enterprises, DAOs, what have you — can leverage its public chain while remaining anonymous, as if they were using cash. That reality has led to recent calls in the Ethereum community for the creation of a reliable mixer, one that could be used to obscure transactions’ participants in trustless fashion.  Now, thanks to the efforts of one “genius” developer, a promising stab at such a mixer has arrived in Heiswap. Built by Kendrick Tan, Heiswap — hosted at heiswap.exchange — is an Ethereum mixer that obfuscates the origins and recipients of ether (ETH) in mixing fixed sums of the cryptocurrency, its blockchain’s figurative fuel. Tan’s work builds off the minimal design specification Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin published back in May, the spec being a near-immediate response to Ethereum community member Eric Conner’s call for a “basic mixing service.”  At the time, Buterin outlined a “simple mixer for sending fixed quantities of ETH.” As such, Tan built Heiswap from that outline and has since released the mixer on Ethereum’s Ropsten testnet. Upon publishing the dapp, Tan was hailed as one of the “[r]andom geniuses” currently working around Ethereum by Buterin.  The mixer uses a smart contract, into which users can submit fixed amounts of ether — e.g. 0.1 ETH, 10 ETH, etc. — that is afterward matched with another user’s similarly denominated sum in order to hide a transaction’s true source. As Tan explained of the project: Similarly to Monero (XMR), Heiswap’s privacy scheme utilizes so-called ring signatures, Tan added: Of course, it must be noted that Heiswap has yet to be audited, as Tan said he didn’t have the necessary funds to enlist an audit by himself. An interesting possibility on the auditing front could come from MolochDAO, an open-source group of Ethereum stakeholders that are crowdfunding Ethereum development projects. Ameen Soleimani, the chief executive officer of SpankChain and the founder of MolochDAO, had previously floated the idea of paying for someone via a Moloch grant to develop a mixer from the minimal design spec Buterin had provided.  Now that Tan has seemingly provided such a mixer, perhaps Soleimani and his Moloch peers would be willing to shift funds to an audit of Heiswap instead. Of course, that’s a matter for MolochDAO to decide, but it’s a possibility that could conceivably gain consensus going forward. Notably, Heiswap is underpinned by smart contract tech rather than servers, which can be seized. That dynamic will work in its favor with regard to censorship resistance. In May, European authorities seized six servers powering the bitcoin mixer service Bestmixer. To be sure, mixer’s aren’t only for criminals, but the aforementioned authorities determined the service had become popular among money launderers. In contrast, Buterin’s mixer design came in response to Ethereum users wanting to join a DAO, specifically HumanityDAO, without publicizing their main addresses.",

        "passage": "The Bank of Finland has released a paper called “The Great Illusion of Digital Currencies”. In it, author Aleksi Grym calls all cryptocurrencies “a fallacy”. The author argues that “currency cannot be digitized” and that blockchain-based ledger systems are “not significantly different from other financial record-keeping technology”.  Before we get into the paper, we need to consider where it’s coming from first. This paper was published by the Bank of Finland, which by no surprise is the central bank of Finland. According to Wikipedia, the bank is the country’s “monetary authority, and is responsible for the country’s currency supply”. Naturally, such an institution has a lot to lose in terms of control over global finance if something like bitcoin were to replace its freely printed fiat currency. With that in mind, let’s go over some of the key arguments posed in the paper. The author of the paper takes great pains in explaining why they believe the distributed letter technology of pioneered by bitcoin is not revolutionary or even new. By their definition, having a ledger that exists across multiple servers and updates automatically through the Internet is old news. This assertion, however, indicates a severe lack of understanding in what bitcoin actually represents. In a traditional, closed system where only pre-approved and trusted parties are given access to a distributed ledger (like a network of government owned banks), then perhaps on the surface this assertion would appear to be correct. A network like this could easily keep track of transactions and share data amongst each other so that a shared ledger is up to date. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that use any type of mining are trustless systems in which anyone can participate. It is this democratization of information that is the revolution, not the data sharing. In order for one to mine bitcoin, they do not need pre-approval, a license, or proprietary software in order to participate. It is this openness that also forces honesty and transparency. In a closed system of only pre-approved nodes, things can easily be manipulated upon the agreement of the small set of participants. For instance, in the case of digital money, this small network could easily just say to themselves, let’s print one hundred million dollars worth of currency and then give it out to our political allies, all with the public having no access to this information. On a system like bitcoin where everything is out in the open at all times, and anyone is allowed to participate without needing any kind of license or approval, this sort of underhanded tactic to undermine the value of the currency is effectively impossible.  Read The Problems with Fiat Currency If new bitcoin were to suddenly appear outside of the established rules, chaos would ensue. In the global fiat system, new money simply appears and disappears every day, and no-one bats an eye. One classic attack on cryptocurrencies from the old financial world is the tired and oft debunked claim that bitcoin has “no intrinsic value“. For this overused and malformed point, we refer to famed economist Saifedean Ammous who wrote The Bitcoin Standard. In his book, Ammous argues that money is a concept that appears in all human societies and can take many forms. Be it large stones, sea shells, beads, gold, minted coins, printed paper, and so on. The problem with most forms of money is that they lack or fail to maintain their hardness. Basically speaking, the more difficult a form of currency is to produce or acquire, the harder it is. Ammous writes: Gold, for example, cannot just be picked up anywhere on the ground. Getting gold from nature requires complex and expensive mining. Further, gold only exists on earth in a finite amount. And while gold may be a good store of value, it is not necessarily a good currency because it is not highly fungible, divisible, or easily verifiable. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are instead an ideal form of money because they have hardness, a fixed supply, and are effectively immune from hyperinflation and other manipulation by central banks that would act selfishly to print reams of cash only to accomplish their own selfish goals. While the author calls bitcoin a fallacy, the idea that a currency requires institutional backing of any kind is in itself a fallacy of logic. We would highly doubt that the Bank of Finland would consider gold to be a monetary asset that requires some sort of authority to back it. On the contrary, precious metals and gems require no central authority, central bank, or mint in order for them to hold any degree of value. The same is true for any number of commodities like chocolate or cement. A chocolate bar does not need to get a stamp from the “Central Chocolate Authority of Finland” in order to be considered real chocolate. The assertion that all objects that hold any degree of value need an institution of some kind put its stamp on it is foolhardy at best, and downright ignorant at worst.  Examining Wall Street’s Love-Hate Relationship with Bitcoin A large reason why bitcoin is so highly valued is simply because it does not require a central institution of any kind in order for it to operate and fulfill its primary function of being a means of storing and transacting value. Centralized authorities create central points of failure, and easy means of manipulation. Bitcoin suffers from none of these weaknesses, and that is not by accident, but by design. The entire argument made by this paper seems to come crashing down in its brief conclusion section. Specifically, the author states that if a central bank were to release its own cryptocurrency, then it would indeed be a true currency by the definition of the author. This is because it would then be “backed” by an institution, and not simply the creation of some computer geeks or anarchists. It is in this paragraph that we see the author specifies that cryptocurrencies could function as a currency, but they somehow assert that without a central issuing authority, any currency is destined to fail. Once again, we must point to the example of gold, in that there is no issuing authority that prints out gold. Instead, gold is a decentralized asset that exists within nature and is not owned or controlled by any one central body like a central bank. If a government were to create a cryptocurrency, it would only be hard money if it had a set supply and was immune to hyperinflation. If it could be endlessly printed or minted, then it would be just as subject to manipulation as any other form of fiat currency. It’s clear from this paper that the author from the Bank of Finland does not really understand cryptocurrency, beyond simply seeing as a threat to their own established means of control. They seem to view the features the bitcoin network very intentionally implemented as being weaknesses, instead of strengths. We here at Blockonomi would suggest that the Bank of Finland should take more time to really understand why people are attracted to cryptocurrency before simply slamming it for not fitting into the established paradigm of centralized and highly manipulated fiat currency markets.

        "passage": "Environmental practices are now at the forefront of governmental policy objectives at every corner of the globe. Whilst global ambitions to live in a more sustainable world are now being discussed at a U.N. level, U.S. manufacturer SC Johnson are looking to utilize the power of blockchain technology to further incentivize society to play their part. According to an official SC Johnson press release, the manufacturer – who are behind global cleaning product brands such as Mr Muscle, Scrubbing Bubbles, Kiwi, Glade, Shout and Ziploc, are looking to collaborate with Plastic Bank, a leading environmental organization focused on reducing plastic ocean-based waste. The report explains that five nations in particular-  notably Thailand, Vietnam, China, Indonesia and the Philippines, are responsible for over 55% of all plastic waste dumped in to the world’s oceans. Taking this in to account, the project will initially begin in Indonesia, with the opening of 8 plastic collection sites across the country.  The idea behind the proposal is to reward individuals that deposit plastic waste at one of the regional centres, in the form of cryptocurrency. This acts as a major incentive for those involved as the report explains that the tokens can then be used to buy goods and services. Furthermore, as the project will be supported by blockchain technology, it practically alleviates the threats of loss or theft, ensuring that each centre remains transparent and accountable. SC Johnson explain that close to 28 million people live below the poverty line in Indonesia, so the incentivization program has the opportunity to benefit a vast group of demographics. With the first centre opening in Bali in late October 2018, it is hoped that Indonesia will have its 8 centres fully operational by May 2019. After that, the plan is to then begin operations in neighbouring Asian nations. Although it remains to be seen what specific blockchain protocol the project will be built on top of, the report suggests that users will be able to access their tokens via a bespoke Plastic Bank mobile application. This comes as welcome news for environmental think-tanks, as ocean pollution is on the brink of disaster. According to Marine Safe – a UK-based NGO, more than 215 million metric tonnes of plastics found their way in to the ocean in 2010. This isn’t the first time that a leading organization has looked to tackle global issues through the utilization of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In May 2017, it was announced that the U.N were looking to use the Ethereum blockchain to distribute food rations in the form of coupons, to refugees living in Jordan. By removing the need for physical cash, it drastically reduces the threats of aid donations getting in to the wrong hands However, it is also important to recognize that leading cryptocurrency projects also need to play their part too. With energy consumption levels growing at an exponential rate as a result of Proof-of-Work mining algorithms, it is estimated that Bitcoin alone demands more electricity than 159 different nations. Moreover, with the vast majority of mining farms based in China, a nation that has a somewhat murky reputation when it comes to environmental standards, many argue that the energy-intensive characteristics of cryptocurrency mining is counter-intuitive to the underlying aims of the digital phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to see that the use of cryptocurrencies is being considered by major organizations with the view of making the world a more sustainable place. Although still in its early days, it will interesting to see what effects the SC Johnson and Plastic Bank collaboration yields.",

        "passage": "According to a news release earlier this week, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) supported the development of a blockchain explorer. The new explorer was developed with help from the NRC’s Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). Blockchain start-up Bitaccess built the new platform, and it is hosted on the widely-used InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).  Bitaccess co-founder Moe Adham, had this to say about the program in a statement that was made after the new explorer was released, The NRC explained that they chose IPFS because it operates as a peer-to-peer file sharing network that is highly resistant to shock. Programs that are hosted on the IPFS are nearly impossible to change, or remove. Users can use this new explorer to locate information about public grants, and other subjects on the Ethereum blockchain. Canada wasn’t a major development center for cutting-edge technology in the 20th century, but that appears to be changing. Ethereum was more or less born in Canada, and numerous blockchain start-ups have chosen to make Canada their home.  Read: What is Interplanetary File System IPFS?  Canada’s financial markets are often overshadowed by their neighbor to the south. US financial markets are arguably the largest in the world, but Canada brings a lot of flexibility to innovators that can’t afford to deal with the huge costs of bureaucracy in the USA. The first crypto-miners to go public did so in Canada, due to the ease of doing business there. HIVE Blockchain was a market darling on the TSX-V (Toronto Venture Exchange) last year. Like most things in the crypto sector, it has since cooled off. Canada was also the first major nation to allow a blockchain ETF to list on their exchanges. Next month, it looks like another blockchain ETF is set to be listed for public trading.  Read: HIVE Blockchain Technologies: Publicly Listed Crypto Mining Company The blockchain ETF that Vancouver-based First Block Capital (FBC) plans to list next month won’t be the fabled Bitcoin ETF that US investors have been waiting for. Instead of focusing on the wildly volatile crypto sector, FBC plans to invest in major companies that are working with blockchain technology. FBC is looking at companies like IBM, Maserk and Walmart, probably because they are securing blockchain patents, and have the ability to take on long-term development programs. This ETF may not deliver the kind of returns that some tokens created last year, but over a long-term time horizon, it may prove to be a safer way to invest in the blockchain space. Mike Novogratz has been one of the most outspoken proponents for blockchain in the public arena. A former Goldman Sachs employee, he has been working to take his crypto merchant bank, called Galaxy Digital Holdings, public for more than a year. It finally happened at the beginning of August, though the current bear market in crypto prices hasn’t helped Galaxy much.  Read: Mike Novogratz’s Crypto Merchant Bank Loses Big In First Quarter Mike Novogratz had this to say right before Galaxy shares began trading on the TSX-V, Although the shares initially rose to over C$3, they have since fallen to C$2.35. Other companies like HIVE Blockchain, have seen even larger falls from the heady days of 2017. HIVE shares rallied as high as C$4.71, though they recently traded as low as C$.68. Regardless of the roller-coaster ride in crypto prices, Canada has shown that it is willing to accept blockchain technology, and allow start-ups to take the risks that can lead to great companies.",

        "passage": "As Starbucks shops are preparing for the integration of Bakkt, the famous coffee shop’s customers will have the opportunity to pay for their favorite coffee with bitcoin (BTC); however, tax returns might represent a serious problem to the functionality of the crypto-based payment system. The point of mass adoption in terms of accepting cryptocurrencies as alternative payment methods across various retail shops comes down to the case of spending your digital assets as quickly as fiat.  In the meanwhile, many shops started to accept bitcoin alongside several cryptocurrencies, but the mass adoption is yet to bring the cryptos to mainstream as the majority of businesses accepting crypto as an alternative payment method are said to be small and medium companies. This case might soon see serious changes as Starbucks most recently received significant equity in Bakkt, although the coffee giant is not holding any cash investments in this cryptocurrency ecosystem. As reported by The Block, Starbucks is currently working on designing and developing an application and a card that will allow the coffee magnum to become “Bakkt’s first merchant-on-platform”. Initially, only the customers based in the United States will be able to use bitcoin to cover their coffee bill at Starbucks. The equity stake was issued after the partnership between Starbucks and Bakkt was made official, while Starbucks agreed to allow bitcoin-based payments in return. The partnership announcement was in the meanwhile postponed as the companies were waiting for the decision from CFTC.  However, although the recent partnership with Bakkt brought bitcoin to Starbucks as one of the available payment methods, the famous chain of coffee shops doesn’t actually accept direct deposits in BTC, which means that during the payment, BTC is being exchanged to US dollars as enabled by Bakkt software. In this case scenario the most significant obstacle is the fact that this type of payment processing mechanism calls for tax reporting for the coffee you are buying, which is why some Twitter users are reminding crypto enthusiasts that all Starbucks customers paying with bitcoin will be required to count the capital gains on every cup of coffee bought with BTC.  Although the coffee giant is making a step that could be categorized as a significant leap towards the mainstream adoption of bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies likewise, Starbucks customers who wish to pay for their coffee with bitcoin might face some difficulties due to the tax reporting. Back in 2014, the IRS published guidance on the subject of cryptocurrency where it is clearly stated that virtual currencies are to be treated as property, while all generalities included in the principle on paying taxes on the property will likewise be applicable on cryptocurrency-based transactions. That means that every time a customer would pay for their coffee in bitcoin, they would need to take the price of BTC at the time of the purchase then compare it to the price of bitcoin at the time of the filing taxes to calculate capital gains and losses. Just as capital losses can be redeemed through tax filings, capital gains on the coffee purchases also need to be covered within taxation, which makes bitcoin-based purchases at Starbucks perhaps a bit too much to handle for an average crypto enthusiast craving for a latte.",

        "passage": "On the one hand, Bitcoin continues to suffer its longest-running bear market, 414 days and counting as at the time of writing this article. However, reports indicate that more cryptocurrencies were stolen in 2018 than in other previous years. We asked Rafal Szymanski to give his expert opinion about this. Why is cryptocurrency theft on the increase when the prices are significantly lower than they were at the back end of 2017? Well, the answer could lie in the notion that centralized cybercrime syndicates are responsible for a large portion of such thefts; especially the ones concerning exchange platforms.  A January 2019 report published by CipherTrace, a blockchain analysis firm, revealed that cybercriminals stole about $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies throughout 2017. According to the report, crypto theft went up by 400 percent from the figures recorded in 2017. When the bear market struck, and Ether prices fell, many ICO projects suffered the consequences. With Ethereum being the de facto platform of choice for many of these projects, liquidity problems soon became a nagging issue. The Menlo-Park based CipherTrace reports that investors lost close to $750 million to exit scams in 2018. Last year also saw the emergence of criminal charges being brought against principal actors associated with scam ICOs. With the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies falling by more than 80 percent, it appears odd that more of it is being stolen. Not only is crypto theft on the rise, but experts say more cybercriminals are developing more elaborate means of achieving their aims. One of such growing threats is the emergence of carefully orchestrated inside jobs leading to the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition to hackers gaining unauthorized entry to crypto wallets, people working in cryptocurrency firms are allegedly collaborating to exploit investors. QuadrigaCX, a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange is currently in the news after the death of its CEO and the inability of the company to access close to $260 million held in cold storage. However, feelers from cryptocurrency forensic specialists say that the platform had no cold storage and that funds are domiciled in online exchange platforms. Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell corroborated seemed to corroborate these reports in a recent tweet. A 2019 report by Chainalysis revealed another dimension to the incessant cryptocurrency hacking incidents. According to the report, about 60 percent of all such attacks are the work of two cybercrime cartels. If the report is accurate, then those exchange hacks that leave hundreds of millions of dollars stolen are organized crimes. If so, it might explain why there is still an allure for such nefarious activities even in a bear market. According to Chainalysis, the two cartels which the report designated as “Alpha and Beta” have two different motives for their attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Alpha syndicate supposedly are anarchists, with the attacks merely serving as a prelude to more sinister goals. The Beta team, on the other hand, simply wants to make money.",

        "passage": "As the markets took a big tumble in the past day to the SEC’s decision to postpone their decision on a Bitcoin ETF, Wall Street analyst Tom Lee is once again weighing in on bitcoin. He states that the currency is slowly regaining its market share, a sign that the coin is “returning” following a lengthy series of price slumps that began in January of this year. He advises bitcoin enthusiasts to stay calm and patient as the cryptocurrency continues its gradual ascension of the financial ladder.  Image from Coin360 Long considered one of bitcoin’s biggest advocates, Tom Lee has often spoken of the currency’s price, and predicted positive outcomes when most of his colleagues have fallen victim to negative sentiment. For months, Lee has predicted that bitcoin will finish the year at $25,000, though he recently changed this figure to an even $20,000, meaning bitcoin would be no higher than where it stood in December 2017. This has aroused skepticism in die-hard bitcoin addicts. At press time, the largest digital currency by market cap is trading for just over $6,500 – hardly something to get excited about considering it was almost $13,000 higher eight months ago. This means bitcoin would need to spike by over $10,000 in just 16 weeks if Lee’s prediction is to come true. Nevertheless, the financial expert has stuck to his guns about bitcoin’s ending value, which in turn has caused many notable figures in the cryptocurrency arena to weigh in with their own predictions. Arthur Hayes – co-founder of BitMEX – believes that bitcoin could end the year at $50,000, while Tim Draper alleges that bitcoin will strike $250,000 in 2022. Tom Lee has also offered additional predictions, stating that bitcoin could hit the $91,000 mark in 2020. Lee fully admits that bitcoin’s price is nowhere near his initial end-of-year figure, nor does he believe the price is where it should be. However, he says the currency’s market value is the true indicator of bitcoin’s strength, and he alleges it’s slowly returning from oblivion. “The news that we have seen from the SEC saying bitcoin’s a commodity, to the potential for an [exchange-traded fund] is causing investors to decide that bitcoin is the best house in a tough market,” he recently explained on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” He continues on to say, “Bitcoin isn’t broken if it’s holding at its present levels. I think people are afraid it is going to go back down to $6,000 or whatever, and that it will never come back from those bear markets.” The biggest indicator of bitcoin’s strength, he asserts, is the “regaining of its market share.” At the time of writing, bitcoin dominates nearly half of the cryptocurrency market (47.6 percent). While this is nowhere near the 80 percent peak bitcoin held in January 2017, it’s a solid mark above the weak and unstable 36 percent it possessed just a year later. In addition, big things are happening in the bitcoin space that Lee believes could potentially assist the currency’s market value to grow even further. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently made it clear that bitcoin was not – and never would be – a security but was, in fact, a commodity, along with most other forms of crypto. While regulation may still occur in the future, one can expect to witness legislation that will be less stringent and easier to bear. In addition, the Intercontinental Exchange announced last Friday that it was entering partnerships with several major companies – including Microsoft and Starbucks – to potentially build a large, open and regulated digital asset ecosystem. Lee is confident such a system could assist in bitcoin’s legitimization. He also says that while bitcoin is not “openly” reacting to what’s occurring in the news through relative price increases, it’s growing market value indicates that the currency is garnering a solid financial base. “I think bitcoin dominance is actually showing that the market is reacting to what’s been taking place,” he claims.",

        "passage": "Just two days after suddenly making demands for all customers identity documents, the company known as Hashflare has released an email hours ago titled “[IMPORTANT] End of Mining Service of SHA-256 Contracts”. According to the email, all current SHA-256 bitcoin mining contracts will be terminated today, July 20. Many on Twitter and Reddit are calling this an exit scam.  According to the email that just went out, the company has been unable to make any bitcoin payments to its contract holders for the last 28 consecutive days due to the amount earned being allegedly less than the daily maintenance fee the company charges. This, they claim, what is causing all contracts to be terminated prematurely. The email states that the company is within its rights to do this as the action is “in accordance with clause 5.5 of our Terms of Service, which are required to be accepted when creating a purchase and are the basis of concluding the contract.” Clause 5.5 of the terms of service reads: The terms seem to be unaltered, as an identical copy can be found on archive.org stretching back to at least last year. The community reaction has so far been overwhelmingly negative. Some users who joined the service just recently and stand to suffer the most loses have claimed that they are trying to perform a chargeback with their banks. Others are stating that they considering filing law suits against the Estonia-based company, but it’s too soon to tell whether or not anyone will proceed with legal action.  Another subset of users are questioning the legitmacy of Hashflare’s claim that mining is no longer profitable. Users are posting screen shots of mining calculator sites like Coinwarz.com which suggests that currently mining is profitable, especially considering the uptick in price that bitcoin has seen in the last week. But profitability is apparently not enough, as the terms seem to be that mining hasn’t to be profitable enough to pay for their own maintenance fees Other users had interesting comments to share, such as these:   Today’s announcement comes several months after Hashflare suddenly changed all pre-existing bitcoin mining contracts from being “lifetime” to one-year. That sudden change in policy which the company again justified via its contractual terms caused support for the company to plummet. That change seems moot, however, as all bitcoin mining contracts still faced cancellation in much the same way that we saw today.  Another point to consider is that just two days prior to this, the company suddenly started requiring all users to submit ID data to identify themselves. Users who failed to do so were told they could potentially lose access to their accounts if they failed to comply. The timing of this sudden requirement seems coincidental, and some users are suggested this was done as a protective measure against impending lawsuits. Redditor /u/urgodfather had a few things to say for those considering legal action. With this announcement, it is our guess that the community has likely lost all trust in Hashflare. The companies main competitor, Genesis Mining, appears to still be paying out and has not made any statement so far on Hashflare’s actions. Previously when Hashflare changed their contracts from life time to one-year, Genesis Mining released a statement saying they would never take advantage of legal jargon to act against their customers best interests. For those who currently have a balance on Hashflare, it appears that the previous withdrawal minimums of 0.02 BTC have been removed. However, the site is currently imposing a 0.01 BTC maximum daily withdrawal, which is around $75 at today’s prices. For users that previously had lifetime contracts, they will only be losing about a months worth of potential mining income as that change occurred 11-months ago. But for those that joined just recently, they stand to lose as much as a year of mining profits. It’s also quite likely that cloud mining itself will take a hit and fewer users will be willing to invest in it as a result of the collapse of Hashflare.",

        "passage": "Despite the collapse of the Bitcoin price through 2018, bankers and regulators still seem to be on their toes about cryptocurrency. After all, this newfangled asset class presents a threat to the traditional banking system and fiat monies, as something like BTC is neither directly controllable or taxable. So, it should come as no surprise that the Philippines, which some see as a hub for crypto adoption (I personally know many coworkers that live there), is looking to crack down on the industry.  Speaking to PhilStar Global, a local English media outlet, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) representative Benjamin Diokno said that his organization will continue to address the “risks” that come alongside the usage of cryptocurrency. Diokno, a governor of the institution, explained that he is worried about the usage of digital assets in terrorist financing, which is a pertinent issue with entities like Hamas and ISIS purportedly using Bitcoin to exchange value. With the Philippines experiencing an array of deadly bombings over recent years, it’s no surprise that the governor is on edge about this subject matter. This isn’t the only issue that the bank sees with cryptocurrencies, however. Diokno’s peer, deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo, told a crowd during the publishing of a Bitcoin-related book warned that BTC and its ilk aren’t viable as alternative forms of money. Guinigundo ventured that due to Bitcoin’s volatility, it would be hard to use it as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. He elaborates: Of course, a central banker wouldn’t be caught dead pushing any other narrative. Anyhow, the reason why there is this newfound scrutiny from the Philippines is seemingly a result of a report that from 2017 to 2018, the value of domestic cryptocurrency payments doubled. The report from PhilStar made no mention of explicit plans, but a crackdown is likely on the table, especially if more domestic money continues to flow into borderless, censorship-resistant digital assets. What’s interesting, the Philippines recently got its first Bitcoin automated teller. Announced earlier this year, the Union Bank of the Philippines, a banking giant that is the seventh largest in the country, launched two buy-and-sell cryptocurrency machines. Union Bank purportedly collaborated with the nation’s central bank, to ensure that this offering is compliant. The Philippines’ recent statements of concern in regards to cryptocurrency comes just days after Bloomberg Quint claimed that India is planning to eliminate all Bitcoin usage within its borders. The article, which cited a “draft bill”, revealed that regulators in India, from multiple financial and judiciary agencies, revealed that those who involve themselves in the “sale, purchase and issuance of all types” of crypto assets, including Bitcoin, could lead to a ten-year jail sentence and/or fine. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India and its partners have purportedly also proposed the creation of a “Digital Rupee” to fill in the void left by a ban on Bitcoin. This exact strategy has purportedly been “recommended by a panel headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg”, and has been backed by an array of other respected governmental agencies. Funnily enough, the Reserve Bank has since come out to state that it is unaware of any such bill, and that it hasn’t been in any contact with its regulator peers about a new cryptocurrency crackdown. Regardless, many pundits have stated that if India was to try and kill domestic Bitcoin use, it may backfire and actually result in adoption. This, of course, would be the Streisand Effect in action.",

        "passage": "As the bitcoin price crossed over $12,000 USD for the first time this year on late June 25th, traders scarcely had time to notice before buy pressure pushed the genesis cryptocurrency’s valuation up more than $1,000 further in a matter of hours. Indeed, within the first few minutes of June 26th, bitcoin was trading as high as $12,861, a price the bellwether cryptocurrency hovered near into Wednesday afternoon. At the time of this article’s writing, BTC had broken above $13,300, the coin having risen $1,800 over the previous 24 hours to give it an intraday gain of 16 percent.  It’s the latest surge for the cryptocurrency, which has been on nothing short of a tear in recent weeks. Bitcoin has gained $4,000 over the last month and roughly $9,000 over the last three months. The OG crypto is now up 107 percent on the year and down only 35 percent from its all-time high of $20,000, which was reached in late December 2017 at the peak of the cryptoeconomy’s last bull market. Notably, with the market capitalization of BTC presently at $228.63 billion, the bitcoin dominance rate — the cryptocurrency’s share of the entire cryptoeconomy’s market cap — is over 60 percent for the first time since 2017. Fundstrat Global Advisors’s Tom Lee, one of Wall Street’s most vocal cryptocurrency analysts, noted back in April that bitcoin has tended to see its biggest price runs during short periods of time — namely within the span of 10 days on average. That’s not to say that BTC only sees large uptrends during single 10-day lots in any given year. Rather, the dynamic indicates that when bitcoin starts to move up, it can move very fast in acute bursts. For example, it took just over two weeks for the bitcoin price to spike from $10,000 to $20,000 during the 2017 bull run. It remains to be seen if bitcoin can match that rise — and its speed — in the coming days, but such a trajectory is as conceivable as ever if the current marked uptrend is any indication and with mainstream attention starting to materialize around the cryptoeconomy once more. Indeed, the bitcoin price first eclipsed $10,000 for the first time this year on June 21st, less than one week ago. It’s moved up considerably after that, and it may have further momentum yet. With the end of Q2 2019 closing in, BTC is now in the midst of its best-performing quarter since the cryptocurrency spiked up 230 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Ether, the figurative fuel of the Ethereum network and the cryptoeconomy’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also enjoyed a considerable run on June 26th. At the time of this article’s writing, ETH was trading over $355, rising $40 on the day to give the second most popular cryptocurrency an intraday gain of approximately 12 percent. Notably, ETH is up 150 percent over the last three months, though it’s still down 24 percent on the year and down 76 percent from it’s all-time high of $1,431, a peak it reached in early January 2018. Over the last three years, however, ether is up a whopping 2,354 percent. The price surge comes as the Ethereum community has been buzzing over numerous recent developments around their blockchain, perhaps most importantly the tentative plans to launch the “ETH 2.0” Beacon Chain on January 3rd, 2020. There’s been plenty of other peripheral activity, too. For example, new DeFi possibilities like the PoolTogether “no loss” lottery have recently arrived, as well as plans for new layer-two scaling solutions like the Phonon Network (note: the network will also work with Bitcoin and later even more blockchains). Moreover, only days ago cloud computing giant Cloudfare unveiled an Ethereum Gateway, which well let users interact with Ethereum without having to download software.",

        "passage": "Blockchain is getting a lot of attention from universities around the world. It is a hot new field of study, but it can also help universities to share information securely. Higher education is one of the most important areas of modern life. A degree from a prestigious university can be extremely valuable. Unfortunately, there is no international system that helps to establish the legitimacy of a degree.  Today a person who studies in the USA is likely to seek employment in the global job market. Any employer wants to make sure that a potential employee’s educational credentials are accurate. The only way to confirm an educational record today requires direct contact with a university, and potentially other schools as well. In light of this fact, numerous educational institutions came together to create the Groningen Declaration. In short, the Groningen Declaration is a an international effort to streamline information sharing in the global educational community. Today universities are also faced with new challenges to their existing fields of study, which expanded blockchain curriculum could help them overcome. So far more than 40 US universities have signed on to the Groningen Declaration. Globally this number is much higher. Despite the international push for easier access to secure academic records, there has been little in the way of agreement on how the platform could develop further in the real world. According to a report that was authored by Merija Jirgensons and Janis Kapenieks of Riga Technical University (RTU) in Latvia, there doesn’t seem to be a consensus emerging on how best to structure a global blockchain platform. To wit, “The Europeans, especially in the UK, have preferred Ethereum; while the Americans have opted for the bitcoin blockchain,” the report states. The report from RTU goes on to say that, “Most states in the EU are planning blockchain strategies to fit national agendas, and most employ the Ethereum blockchain.” The report cites the MIT Blockcerts application as an example, “(MIT Blockcerts) is currently unavailable for Ethereum,” which is the architecture favored by government developers in Europe. The university system is famous for being slow to adapt to new technology. The rise in DLT is a perfect example of how higher education has been left behind, and is refusing to adopt a more market-oriented approach to their information architecture. When blockchain programs are offered to university students, the level of interest has been extremely high. Blockchain is being researched by numerous global mega-corporations, and has received support that can be measured in the billions of dollars by governments. If universities keep resisting blockchain-based platforms, they risk being shut out of an emerging development culture. While many universities have been slow to invest in blockchain education, the University of California at Berkeley (UoC Berkeley), is working on bringing together blockchain technology, education, and the community. Ben Bartlett asked an assembly of students at UoC Berkeley, “We have at least 1,400 homeless people in our city, and that includes many right here at UC Berkeley,” Councilman Bartlett told the class. “So how can we use blockchain to fund a new prosperity? That’s a challenge I’d like you to take on.” The class that city council member Ben Bartlett was addressing is being taught by Po Chi Wu, who is a visiting professor and former venture capitalist. UoC Berkeley isn’t alone in offering blockchain courses to their students. New York University, Stanford, and Georgetown are also jumping into a field that has created a 200% rise in job postings on a yearly basis. In a field that is just beginning to hit the mainstream, universities that choose to develop curriculum that helps their students enter a growing industry are going to secure long term access to the blockchain world via their alumni. For the moment there is little interaction between the government in the US and nascent blockchain-focused university departments, which is another area where other nations seem to be pulling ahead of the USA.",

But, as the asset’s block reward reduction has neared, LTC has been imbued with an increase in investment interest and adoption. Revealed earlier this week, an up-and-coming crypto payments startup has added Litecoin, making it the fifth digital asset available on its platform.  Read: What are Flexa & Spedn? Complete Guide According to a recent blog post, Litecoin has now been formally added to Flexa, a payments ecosystem that allows merchants to accept cryptocurrencies and receive U.S. dollars. The “OG” Bitcoin fork, created by former Google and Coinbase engineer Charlie Lee, joins Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and the Gemini Dollar — the four original assets that garnered support from Flexa on May 13th. Seemingly explaining why it was making this addition, Flexa writes in the release that LTC “distinguishes itself” from other blockchain platforms with low transaction fees (often under $0.01), fast confirmation times (2.5 minutes), high volumes, “and an active community of avid supporters and payments enthusiasts.” Indeed, Litecoin is known to have an impassioned community.  As of the time of press, Litecoin can now be used to purchase goods via Flexa in over 39,250 stores (and counting) across the United States. Retail and restaurant chains that accept Flexa-backed payments, which are routed primarily through Gemini, include Baskin Robbins, Bed Bath & Beyond, GameStop, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Petco, and Whole Foods — the last of which is arguably the most notable because the luxury grocery store is owned by Amazon. Speaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei on Wednesday, Lee told a crowd: Litecoin can now be spent, and thus converted to fiat, via Flexa’s SPEDN application, which is currently live on Apple’s iOS and in testing on Android. This comes shortly after the Litecoin Foundation, the organization behind much of the cryptocurrency’s development and adoption, joined hands with two crypto industry partners, Bibox Exchange and Ternio, to release a debit card that can be “loaded” with LTC, Bibox Token, and Ternio Token. This is arguably bigger news than Flexa, as it allows users to spend any of the aforementioned digital assets in any store that accepts Visa plastic. This comes as cryptocurrencies at large have begun to see their viability as a medium of exchange, both digitally and physically, swell. As reported by this outlet on a previous date, video game streaming service Twitch has begun to accept subscription payments via BitPay once again, giving viewers a chance to contribute to their favorite gamers with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Also, electronics distributor Avnet, privacy-centric browser Tor, and telecommunications giant AT&T recently added cryptocurrency payments.

        "passage": "The story behind the Ponzi scheme operated by BitConnect has taken a new turn, as the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is now seeking help from BitConnect investors. According to a statement published on its website, the federal law agency is soliciting help from those who purchased the BitConnect Coin (BCC) token, urging them to help in the ongoing case by filling out a voluntary questionnaire on its website. The agency adds that while responses are voluntary, they would be “useful” in helping it to build its case. Also, responses from investors could also lead to further questioning from the federal law agency, the website states.  BitConnect ran a crypto lending platform that was closed down in January 2018, after the firm was hit with various cease-and-desist orders from state securities regulators in both North Carolina and Texas, who claimed that the company was offering unregistered securities in the states. Both orders had a devastating effect on the coin, leading to the drastic erosion of the coin’s value. In January alone, the coin lost about 90 percent of its value, crashing from $400 to $20. Due to the sudden loss in value of BCC as well as the abrupt closure of the company’s platform, investors filed a class action suit against the company in a bid to claim back their lost funds. The suit was filed with the Southern District Court of Florida, and it alleged that BitConnect issued unregistered securities and then sought additional funds from the investors in a “wide-ranging Ponzi scheme.” According to the documents filed with the Court, the plaintiffs alleged that BitConnect launched a lending program that required its investors to send in crypto assets in exchange for the platform’s BCC token, and the company promised them either a 40 percent return on their investment or a 3,000 percent compounded annually. Per the document filed by plaintiffs, they argued that rather than using the funds sent in by investors for cryptocurrency trading, BitConnect ran an elaborate Ponzi scheme, paying existing investors with funds from new members. BitConnect Australia promoter and shareholder John Bigatton had his account frozen and a travel ban imposed on his movement by the Federal Court of Australia in January. The travel ban and fund freeze were put in motion by Australia’s financial regulator ASIC who started building its case against Bigatton since last December. The U.S. states of Illinois and Arizona also took steps to limit the activities of the promoters in India. The regulators urged the Indian Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to seize the assets of BitConnect promoters, suspected of raising around $5 billion from investors. So far, law enforcement officials in India have arrested the Indian head of BitConnect, Divyesh Darji. Darji, who was a resident of the city of Surat, already had a “look out” circular issued against him. He was eventually arrested at Delhi airport on August 18, 2018, after local immigration officers gave a tip-off to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Indian state of Gujarat police. As of now, the case against BitConnect is running as a single legal effort in the United States. Back in October 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida initiated an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint that also included additional promoters and owners of BitConnect whose names weren’t included in any previous lawsuits. The amended class action included a list of new defendants, including YouTube, which was sued for giving BitConnect’s promoters the ability to publish over 70,000 of content. The consolidated lawsuit called for a jury trial, and sought a remittance of all investments made by the plaintiffs. It also requested additional cash payments in damages.",

In their associated announcement, Rakuten said that the exchange’s former operations will be phased out by the end of March in anticipation of relaunching the new exchange’s services next month. “Rakuten Wallet will support sound development of the industry, and provide a safe and trustworthy user experience by further strengthening its security and service offerings,” the company’s announcement noted. Rakuten Wallet will be followed up in May with the launch of Taotao, a new cryptocurrency exchange that’s raised attention because of one of its investors: Yahoo! Japan. Last spring, YJFX, a subsidiary of the Japanese arm of Yahoo, acquired a 40 percent stake in the crypto exchange BitARG Exchange Tokyo. The enterprise, reportedly purchased for around $20 million, has since been re-envisioned under the moniker of Taotao. The new platform will start its formally-approved operations in using bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as its base trading currencies. The firm also plans to offer crypto margin lending positions in bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), and the Ripple ecosystem’s XRP. And Taotao won’t be Yahoo! Japan’s only recent crypto foray. Back in February, the company’s subsidiary Z Corporation participated in an investment round for Aerial Partners, a crypto tax consulting play. If these two investments are any indication, they likely won’t be the last crypto-centric ventures Yahoo! Japan undertakes in the coming months. The question for now is how much further will the company look to expand its cryptocurrency operations going forward: is the pivoting a permanent shift or flexible experimentation? Only time will tell for now. Earlier this month, the Japanese Cabinet approved amendments put forth by the FSA that will tighten rules governing the operations of cryptocurrency margin lending enterprises in the nation. The approvals came after the agency first submitted a report at the end of last year that called for such enterprises to limit the amount of leverage traders could use on their platforms and to officially register with the Japanese government. Now, with the amendments greenlighted, crypto margin trading institutions in the country will only be able to offer leverage that is four times the amount of traders’ deposits. That reconfigured sum stands in stark contrast to some other firms in the global cryptoeconomy that offer leverage as much as 100 times higher than deposits. The new rules will go live in 2020. They come as the FSA has taken an increasingly proactive stance toward its domestic cryptocurrency ecosystem. Last May, the agency released a five-point regulatory framework that demanded cryptocurrency exchanges in the country increase the security of their platforms in the wake of the devastating Coincheck hack, the largest in the history of the cryptoeconomy to date.",

        "passage": "It looks like more big names are coming to the world of blockchain testing in the real world. Reuters reports that Harvard University and The Levi Strauss Company will be teaming up to test a blockchain-powered platform they think could replace external factory health and safety auditors. Blockchain healthcare platforms are also on the rise. Harvard and Levi’s will be teaming up with New America think tank, and deploying the new system into three of Levi’s factories in Mexico. The goal is to create a solid record of health and safety in industrial settings, and remove the inconsistencies that are associated with human auditors.  The director of Harvard T.H. Chan’s Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise, Dr. Eileen McNeely, commented that, “For the last 25 years, work in supply chains has been monitored mainly by audits… A distributed system of inquiry on the blockchain that goes right to the source offers a new solution.” The initial testing will comprise 5,000 workers and could lead to much wider usage of the system if it is successful. The blockchain that will be used in the pilot program is being designed by ConsenSys. Joseph Lubin founded ConsenSys, and was also one of Ethereum’s (ETH) original developers. There are many areas where blockchain could be applied to healthcare. Blockchain’s ability to create independent records could lead to greater levels of data sharing, with greater efficiencies realized between industry and healthcare providers. IBM and PNC Bank are teaming up with Aetna, Anthem, and Health Care Service Corporation to look for ways that blockchain could make a difference in healthcare. The companies stated that, “The aim is to create an inclusive blockchain network that can benefit multiple members of the healthcare ecosystem in a secure, shared environment…The goal is to allow the blockchain network to enable healthcare companies to build, share and deploy solutions that drive digital transformation in the industry,” in a recent announcement. The first phase of their collaboration will be a ‘health utility network’, which will work to identify use cases which blockchain can be used to secure the exchange if healthcare data. Healthcare records are extremely important, but the shift to Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) has been troublesome. Many doctors have complained about the process of entering data, and the lack of efficiencies in the EHR platforms. Aetna is one of the largest managed care companies in the USA. Its Chief Technology Officer, Claus Jensen, said that, ”We are committed to improving the healthcare consumer experience and making our healthcare system work more effectively,” and also, “Through the application of blockchain technology, we’ll work to improve data accuracy for providers, regulators, and other stakeholders, and give our members more control over their own data.” Healthcare providers are facing rising costs. The population in the USA needs to have better access to care, without it costing more than it does already. The five companies involved in the venture are hoping that blockchain can make administrative activities more efficient, and also make data more accurate. Chris Ward, the Head of Product at PNC Treasury Management, commented that, “This alliance will enable healthcare-related data and business transactions to occur in way that addresses market demands for transparency and security, while making it easier for the patient, payer and provider to handle payments” and that, “Using this technology, we can remove friction, duplication, and administrative costs that continue to plague the industry.” It is easy to see that blockchain development is catching on in a big way. Lori Steele, who is IBM’s General Manager for Healthcare and Life Sciences, said that, “Blockchain’s unique attributes make it suitable for large networks of members to quickly exchange sensitive data in a permissioned, controlled, and transparent way,” and that, “The fact that these major healthcare players have come together to collaborate indicates the value they see in working together to explore new models that we think could drive more efficiency in the healthcare system and ultimately improve the patient experience.” It would be hard to imagine a more glowing endorsement of a new technology than that. Hopefully, these efforts help industry to create better records and also keep healthcare costs as affordable as possible.",

        "passage": "Amid news that TD Ameritrade, Fidelity Investments, E*Trade, Facebook, and Microsoft continue to delve into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, the spotlight pointing at QuadrigaCX has seemingly been turned off. But, all eyes are focused on the disgraced, now-defunct Canadian digital asset exchange once again, with news that its founder misappropriated customer funds for his own use. This confirms long-held hearsay that arose on Canadian cryptocurrency forums months, if not years back.  It’s been nearly half a year since QuadrigaCX closed after it lost its founder to a health issue, but many are still trying to pick up the pieces. In a recent report published by Ernst & Young, a “Big Four” auditor tasked with presiding over this crazy case, it was revealed that, as some suggested, founder Gerald Cotten was running a fraudulent crypto exchange. Toronto-based litigator Evan Thomas broke down the report.  Per this new document — an exposé if you will — Cotten had, over the years, created fake accounts on QuadrigaCX with equally as fake “dollars” to purchase legitimate Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin from users. From there, he then sent this cryptocurrency to accounts at other exchanges under his name. What’s worse, he didn’t just sell what he embezzled, but he gambled with it. Almost like some crazy speculators during 2017, Cotten purportedly used margin, meaning leverage, to trade (and often lose) the cryptocurrencies that weren’t exactly his. According to logs, which are hard to come by to begin with, Cotten transferred 9,450 BTC, 387,738 ETH, and 239,020 LTC out of Quadriga — an amount of cryptocurrency worth dozens of millions of dollars at current valuations. What’s weird is that the report implies that Cotten may have traded even more Bitcoin than the logs suggest. One “unnamed exchange” received 21,501 BTC to an account under the Canadian businessman’s name. As of the time of writing this, there are purportedly eight BTC left, amounting to a loss of $80 million. Ouch. While there is now much more known about the case than when the news first broke that Cotten had passed, there has yet to be retribution for those affected by this debacle. The thing is, this news, coupled with previous reports on the subject matter, cast doubt on the idea that the creditors of QuadrigaCX will get their money back in full. The following is a story about one affected, who lost $422,000 via the Canadian exchange after depositing Bitcoin. In a heartfelt tell-all posted via Youtube, Tong Zou, a Canadian-born Silicon Valley engineer, explained his story.  He explained that in late-2017, his Silicon Valley peers were cashing in on the crypto craze, as he sat on the sidelines. But as the market peaked, he FOMOed in, taking out three self-described “stupid” loans from the bank to invest into cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, among other popular assets. Eventually, he managed to pay his debts by liquidating his stake in a Bay Area apartment, leaving him with $400,000 left over. As he already had plans to move to Vancouver, where QuadrigaCX was supposedly located, the technologist tried to find ways to take advantage of good exchange rates. Eventually, he decided on using Bitcoin and QuadrigaCX as a medium, as he hoped that he could not only transfer value quickly, but turn a profit too due to the exchange’s Bitcoin-to-CAD risk premium. Of course, when he decided to issue a withdrawal request, the money never came… There are presumably hundreds, if not thousands that are in Zou’s boat. And as it stands, they are seemingly only slated to receive a portion of the funds. But, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation was recently reported to have picked up the case.",

        "passage": "Major exchange Coinbase has just announced that they will soon be offering Ethereum Classic services including buying and selling for fiat currency. A number of respondents on Twitter seem confused and furious that Ripple’s XRP was not chosen. Ethereum Classic fans, on the other hand, are ecstatic. ETC prices jumped 20% following the announcement.  According to the official Coinbase blog post, the company will begin engineering work on adding the coin shortly. Following this, they plan to announce the launch date for trading through their blog and Twitter account. This announcement should come “over the next few months”. This process is notably different than when Bitcoin Cash was added. At that time, a sudden announcement was met with a sudden listing of the asset and the price exploding upwards about an hour before the announcement. This led to accusations of insider trading, which the company promised to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators if any are found. With this new process, company is announcing its intentions to support the asset well in advance of actually doing so. This will allow the market a significant amount of time to mentally prepare for the potentially increased interest in the asset. Following the announcement, trading prices for Ethereum Classic sharply increased and just minutes after 9:20 AM UTC on June 12, prices jumped from $12.88 to a high of $16.15 before slumping back slightly to $15.36 at press time. This is indeed a far cry from what happened with Bitcoin Cash. For those unfamiliar with Ethereum Classic and how it differs from Ethereum, we recommend you take a look at our guide on the subject here. With that in mind, let’s go over some of the recent activity that Ethereum classic has seen.  First, the currency has a very active and well-funded development team that is constantly pushing new technical innovations. In addition, the currency appears to have a highly effective marketing team that recently relaunched all Ethereum classic imagery and branding to one that is much more visually appealing. The currency has also seen growing support from Grayscale, an investment firm that has taken a very strong position in Ethereum classic. Grayscale has been actively funding a series of events called the Ethereum Classic Summit where developers, investors, and business leaders get together in a conference and discuss where the platform is going. Last year’s event was held in Hong Kong, and this year’s event will be held in South Korea. Grayscale also runs an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust, which can be read about here. From a technical perspective, Ethereum Classic is in some ways superior to the original Ethereum. That could be simply because it is a less busy blockchain, for whatever reason transaction fees are well below one cent USD and confirm in just a few seconds. The platform supports all types of smart contracts that Ethereum supports, and even has some unique features of its own that Ethereum does not. What’s also interesting is that Ethereum Classic has chosen to continue being a proof-of-work coin and is not interested in switching to proof-of-stake as Ethereum is. This could be important given that there is now ASIC hardware designed to mine the algorithm that Ethereum Classic runs on. This could cause former Ethereum miners to flood over to Ethereum Classic if the chain continues to be profitable as it is now.  For months now, many commentators have been predicting that the next asset to be added by Coinbase would be Ripple’s XRP. Most commentators believe that because Ripple has made great efforts to appeal to banks and corporations that a company like Coinbase would be interested in it. There are a few possibilities for why Coinbase may have chosen to avoid XRP this time around. One could be the current ongoing class action lawsuit that Ripple is facing in regards to allegations that the currency can be pulled “out of thin air“, and is essentially a never-ending ICO, and is not subject to normal market forces as a result. Further, Ripple’s XRP coin has still seen no formal adoption by any corporation or bank despite its boasting and claims of being superior. Finally there could perhaps be technical reasons on the back and. XRP has been accused of being comparatively centralized as it does not have any form of mining or staking, and instead only offers approved parties to operate nodes that propagate transactions. These reasons could have created a number of technical problems that Coinbase did not want to get involved in. This is just speculation, however, as Coinbase has not made any comment in regards to XRP itself.  While we can’t predict the future or prices, essentially every asset that has been listed on Coinbase has seen strong and consistent gains. Litecoin and Ethereum, for example, both experienced significant price jumps following their listings on Coinbase. The reason for this in part is because Coinbase offers a very convenient way for investors to sell their investments for cash, and it also is typically the first stop for many people new to cryptocurrency as it is a fairly straightforward way to buy it. Adding Ethereum classic to the service will most likely prove to have similar results at least to some degree. This is yet to be seen however, but it’s safe to say that Ethereum Classic’s future just got a whole lot brighter thanks to this announcement.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin, like the Internet, is arguably a neutral technology, letting anyone, anywhere access its blockchain. However, one prominent futurist — the chief executive of a major technology firm — has argued that the cryptocurrency is inherently “bad for humanity”. Here’s why.  Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of major cloud computing and virtual machine company VMWare, recently sat down with Fortune to talk Bitcoin. Contrary to what his technology background may suggest, Gelsinger asserted that he isn’t a fan of the cryptocurrency, bashing what he believes is a high level of energy consumption for the utility it provides to humanity. In fact, he suggested that it is contributing to the ongoing “climate crisis” that many scientists and politicians actively discuss: Indeed, from the perspective of an outsider, Bitcoin seems to be only hurting the environment. A website from researchers at the University of Cambridge revealed earlier this year that the miners backing the Bitcoin network consume more than seven gigawatts of electricity. Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt-hours of energy consumption. This amounts to about 0.25% of the world’s annual electricity consumption, which, for an asset seemingly only used by the fringe, seems quite crazy. However, CoinShares estimates that a majority of Bitcoin miners are powered by renewable, green energy sources. In a 19-page report released late last year, the crypto investment and research firm, claimed that renewable energy makes 77.6% of total Bitcoin mining, citing the concentration of renewable energies in areas where Bitcoin miners are, namely China, Iceland, the west coast of the U.S., and the west coast of Canada. They followed this estimate up this year by claiming that some 75% of Bitcoin mining is renewable. Other sources have verified these claims. In a post for HackerNoon, Robert Sharratt, a former employee of the Natural Resources & Power Group, wrote that Bitcoin is primarily powered by Chinese hydro electricity: The “Bitcoin is killing the Earth” narrative wasn’t the only one that Gelsinger utilized. He added in the Fortune interview that he believes Bitcoin is primarily used for illicit activities, and is thus “bad for humanity”. Gelsinger’s comment is quite reminiscent of those made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and other world leaders over recent weeks. As reported by Blockonomi previously, Pompeo told CNBC last week that the anonymous/pseudonymous transactions that cryptocurrencies can enable do pose a security threat or “risk” to America and its allies. The Trump advisor went on to cite 9/11, invoking the terrorist attack to paint a narrative that this new class of digital payment networks may not be conducive to the safety of humanity. They aren’t exactly wrong. The New York Times recently came out with a lengthy post about how Hamas is using Bitcoin to fund operations. Also, Ciphertrace found that cryptocurrency crime is a multi-billion dollar industry. However, it is important to point out that there are many using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle or as a way to hedge against the fiat system, which may be hurting them. Just look to Cyprus a number of years ago, when Bitcoin spiked in the midst of a seemingly inhumane crackdown on banks.",

        "passage": "I came to the cryptocurrency space with a brief background in political journalism, so once I started diving into crypto, I looked around for critical news resources that could guide me on my fledgling journey into this astonishing “brave new world.” No doubt that’s where you likely find yourself right now. And that’s awesome; you’ve picked a great time to make the same foray, as 2018 is set to be an absolute rollercoaster for the whole crypto ecosystem.  To cut through the volatility and wildness, you’ll need to have various sources of news and educational materials that you can rely on and trust to steer you true. To this end, We want to help you “bookmark” the best resources possible. We’ll break it all down for you. We had to give ourselves a shoutout first! Sincerely, though, we’re well-placed here. Let us explain. Blockonomi caters toward educating our readers. The cryptocurrency space can be incredibly dense to newcomers and novices alike, but anyone can definitely get achieve the level of understanding they desire with a little daily catching up.  That’s where we at Blockonomi come in. We write guides and news features so readers can stay constantly up-to-date in the increasingly booming cryptocurrency craze. We carry guides on the basics, for the recurring waves of new investors: We cover more complicated subjects, too: And we cover important and timely crypto news headlines as well: We are currently hiring more writers and will make the move into the daily news space at some point in 2018 when we decide we will be able to maintain a good balance between educational posts and breaking news. So if you’re looking for a great starting point to dive into the crypto space, we’re ecstatic to help. Then there’s Bitcoin.com. By pure site visitors, Bitcoin.com appears to be the undisputed champion of crypto news sites, bringing in millions of viewers daily. The domain name certainly helps with that, but the page has been around for years and has always been good at scooping adoption and regulation stories for the community.  A few things to note: This site is ran by Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin evangelist who’s now one of the main community leaders behind the recently forked Bitcoin Cash (BCH). And, since the legacy Bitcoin and BCH communities have been trading PR blows and swipes on social media as of late, the two sides have become further polarized and entrenched, leading Ver to direct Bitcoin.com toward a not-so-subtle BCH bias in its news reporting. Now BCH is an interesting project, to be sure. The Bitcoin community in general will undoubtedly require both on-chain and off-chain solutions no matter how grumpy that makes either side, and Bitcoin Cash is angling after the “on-chain” of these solutions in a noteworthy way. Accordingly, it’s just worth pointing out that Bitcoin.com is a “BCH site,” as it were, when it comes down to it. But don’t let that stop you from checking out the headlines there. As mentioned previously, Bitcoin.com is always breaking global crypto news just as fast as anyone else in most cases. In the free market, everyone’s entitled to their opinions. It just helps to be aware of what those opinions are. Cointelegraph is a huge Bitcoin-centric news portal which covers breaking news and publishes a high volume of content each day. It employs a large team of writers and also is available to read in Spanish, Brazilian, Serbian and Japanese. Their news articles stand out by the fact they publish a custom illustration with each article they write so you will have noticed them on your Twitter feed quite regularly.  CCN.com just recently re-branded and changed domains from Cryptocoinsnews.com and is one of the larger news blogs about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. It started life back in 2013 and has grown to be a successful site serving over 100,000 unique visitors per day with good mix of news, reports and features. It is the partner site of Hacked.com which gives trading tips and delves more into ICOs and gives investment advice for a membership fee.  TheMerkle is another news blog which was founded in 2014 and offers a mix of informational posts, sponsored posts and breaking news pieces. It has a smaller team of 4 people who managed to post around 20 posts per day, which are typically shorter in length than other similar sites.  Bitcoinist despite the name focuses on most aspects of the Cryptocurrency world and publishes a good volume of content each day and has a large readership.  The standard of writing is high and they have some interesting information posts also. Their content tends to be shorter in length but they do cover most of the breaking stories so they’re a good one to add to your feed reader / Twitter account for up to date news.    Mainstream outlets haven’t been covering cryptocurrency that much until just recently. Two excellent mainstream sources that have been leading the pack, however, are CNBC and Forbes. Indeed, these outlets are pumping out crypto-based content out as of late, showing that they’re turning their attention to the space in a decisive way. And in this light, they bring the reputational journalistic integrity to the ecosystem in way that only large media firms can bring. The content has a super-polished touch, which is always nice. Check out this recent CNBC interview of macrotrader Mike Novogratz, for example:  Reddit is where users come together on “subs” to share news, have conversations, engage in debates. All that good stuff. On Reddit, then, you have very decentralized and compartmentalized communities that constantly circulate breaking news. So, say, if the Ripple (XRP) price is surging, you can go to /r/Ripple see a slew of headlines posted by users that might explain, or partially explain, the said bull run. Now multiply that scenario across every cryptocurrency project and its associated subreddit, and you’ve got a ton of fantastic news and tools at your fingertips. Just like we mentioned with Bitcoin.com earlier, though, you’ll need to understand that each subreddit is naturally biased in favor of their own project. So /r/ethtrader users aren’t big fans of Litecoin. The /r/Bitcoin and the pro-BCH /r/btc communities hate each other. You know, the typical tribalism you seen in any field of human interest. So just read around to get a fuller picture; don’t take the views expressed on a single subreddit as the end-all-be-all. So of the more heavyweight subreddits include: When it comes to YouTube, there’s two fellows you should definitely follow: Boxmining and Ivan on Tech. Both of these channels are excellent, informative, unbiased, and regularly productive (in the content sense). Boxmining, also known by his name real name Michael, covers cryptocurrency news, reviews, and price analyses everyday. And his insider connections in China give him unparalleled insight into the regulatory atmosphere there. Ivan on Tech, or Ivan, is a programmer by day, so he uses his programming knowledge to help explain the cryptocurrency ecosystem in a way that’s easily understandable and extremely insightful. Subscribe to their channels, and you won’t be disappointed. And even cooler? The two pundits do livestreams together periodically. Check out this brand new one they just hosted. The cryptocurrency arena is extremely news-driven at present. Until boatloads of institutional money stabilizes these coin prices, a bad or good story can send prices shooting up or down. At the fact of the matter is that many Twitter accounts are “creating” news right now. For example, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently hailed OmiseGo (OMG) as his favorite kind of token model on Twitter. That tweet alone sent the OMG price skyrocketing acutely. There’s a lot of great personalities on the platform to follow. From citizen sleuths, to trolls who ask the right questions, to industry insiders that post routinely, you should definitely use Twitter as a pseudo-source for news (upon which you can do further research).",

        "passage": "For the most part, investors abiding by traditional investment strategies have avoided Bitcoin like the plague. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, for instance, called the cryptocurrency “rat poison squared”, later explaining that there isn’t much inherent value in the project. But, there is a rapidly-growing narrative that the need for Bitcoin is growing as the current tumultuous macroeconomic and geopolitical climate is perfect for the industry’s growth. And the chief executive of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, perpetuated said narrative on CNBC on Monday.  Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear over the past week. According to analytics site Coin360, the asset is up around 22% in the past seven days. As of the time of writing this article, the flagship cryptocurrency sits snug at $11,700 — down $2,300 from the year-to-date top, but $2,600 up from the monthly bottom. According to Allaire, who appeared on CNBC’s now seemingly crypto-centric “Squawk Box” segment, this rally has much to do with what is going on in terms of turmoil on the geopolitical stage. He stated: Indeed, Bitcoin began its latest rally around two days ago in direct correlation with a tweet that Donald Trump published in regards to fresh tariffs, which also coincided with a drop in the value of the Chinese Yuan against the U.S. Dollar. This is the seeming second time that tariff-related messages from the Trump administration have resulted in a drop in the CNY/USD and a rally in BTC. This move supports the hearsay that Chinese investors who have managed to skirt regulations are buying Bitcoin to get money out of an increasingly threatened economy. Trade wars aren’t the end of the story. Allaire continued: He isn’t the first to have thought this. Tyler Cowen, a Bloomberg economist-columnist that formerly was a clear skeptic of Bitcoin, recently admitted that the cryptocurrency likely has a big future. One of the four reasons he mentioned in his op-ed was the fact that rising levels of populism around the world will likely force prudent investors to look for safe havens/hedges suitable for our day and age — this being an alternative, uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin. All this corroborates the theories that Bitcoin is the successor to gold. As  Chamath Palihapitiya, a former executive of Facebook and venture capitalist, told CNBC viewers a few weeks back: Allaire concluded his segment by discussing his opinion that the Chinese government is softening their blows against the industry. To back this point, the chief executive suggested that the rulings of certain Chinese courts, like the Hangzhou Internet Court’s admission that Bitcoin is “digital property”, and certain statements of support from large technologists and entire commercial banks is a sign that Bitcoin is becoming an accepted industry in China once again.",

        "passage": "Crypto traders will be pleased to hear that Coinbase – one of the largest digital exchanges in the U.S. – is unveiling two new perks: instant cryptocurrency purchases, and higher daily limits for both deposits and trading. Prior to the announcement, customers of Coinbase were stuck dealing with limits on their account holdings, while purchases often took as long as five days to complete.  The company wrote in a blog post: In addition, customers were once limited to weekly spending amounts of $25,000. That figure has since become the daily limit, which means customers could now purchase close to $200,000 per week if they wanted. The company has released a statement, explaining: Coinbase has been one of the most active digital currency exchanges as of late. The venture recently announced that Ethereum Classic – a coin that resulted from an Ethereum hard fork in 2016 after roughly $3.6 million in ether tokens were stolen by hackers – was being added to its trading platform. This caused a subsequent price hike of nearly 30 percent for the currency. Furthermore, representatives also state that they are considering the addition of five more coins. Lastly, decentralized cryptocurrency startup dYdX is launching new tokens designed to “short Ethereum” and offer crypto traders exposure to something that founder Antonio Juliano considers “more diverse.” The venture’s efforts are being funded by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Juliano commented: Coinbase’s new perks come with some fine print. Only verified users will be able to take advantage of the new features, while debit cards will experience lowered limits of approximately $7,500 a week. If users want to deposit more, they will need to do so through bank transfers. Coinbase explained in its blog that users who have not yet completed the verification process “will be required to do so before having access to instant purchases, new trading limits and the ability to withdraw or send coins off-platform.” In the U.K., customers can also look forward to making deposits in pound sterling through the company’s partnership with Faster Payments. Users can also look forward to lower fees, and less-restrictive limitations that allow transactions of up to 250,000 pounds. While Coinbase has yet to say when, exactly, these new perks will be available, they say users can expect them sometime next month.",

        "passage": "Credits is a growing company that seems to be attracting a lot of attention. Chinese heavyweight Lenovo is one of the latest companies to team up with Credits. According to a press release, Lenovo will be using the Credits platform to develop Internet of Things (IoT) and VR/AR hybrid software. The new software is going to be aimed at numerous industries, including fintech, and logistics.  Credits’ Dapp platform has been increasing in popularity. According to the press release, Credits, “will utilize their blockchain expertise to help facilitate building software,” as a part of Lenovo’s New Vision Technology project. Lenovo sees IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and VR/AR as a major source of innovation in coming years. Credits CEO & founder Igor Chugunov thinks that: Credits’ platform will be used to aid internal operations, and help Lenovo manage their new venture into commercializing cutting edge technology. Credits has been a very popular company lately. Their blockchain platform is capable of performing up to one million transactions per second. Additionally, its offers a processing speed of 0.01 seconds and delivers rock-bottom commission rates as low as $0.001 USD. Credits’ smart-contracts allow users to set cycles and create payment schedules, all of which adds up to a formidable blockchain toolkit. The press release that announced their partnership with Lenovo expanded on Credits’ merits, Credits recently announced that they would be working with Nuggets, who wants to tap their fast and secure payments platform. Nuggets is a UK-based fintech start-up that is focused on e-commerce, and online ID. They entered into partnerships with Alipay and WeChat, which may create opportunities for their services in Asia. Nuggets CEO Alastair Johnson also seems to realize how important speed and low costs are for blockchain adoption, he commented after the partnership was made public. Credits has also cemented partnerships with other innovative start-ups like Quillhash and The TITA Project, which suggests that their blockchain platform is able to be deployed into various niche markets. Unlike some of the original blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Credits’ appears to be excelling in the commercial sphere. Despite all the hype surrounding blockchain, it looks like it is entering the marketplace faster than many anticipated. Although some successful investors have speculated that blockchain is in the midst of a bubble, the fact that numerous major companies are implementing blockchain-based platforms would suggest that blockchain is going to meaningfully impact global industry. Lenovo might be working towards rolling out a payments platform that will easily integrate with IoT technology, and using Credits’ infrastructure as a jumping off point for a new kind of integrated payments system. IoT could change the way that people use everyday technology, but it would have to circumvent the existing financial system. Numerous projects have been either proposed or patented over the last six months that would allow people to use IoT and micro-payments to control the way they use electricity. There are many other areas where blockchain, AI, micro-payments would allow breakthroughs in efficiency. Consumers now control more processing power than ever before. New platforms like VideoCoin seek to buy unused processing capacity to distribute video, and the potential for blockchain-based payments could unlock new ways for people to take full advantage of the computers that they own.  Read: Guide to VideoCoin Charges seems to have created a platform that can make ultra-low value payments feasible, which puts them into a good position to participate in the next generation of efficiency-oriented consumer technology.",

        "passage": "For much of Bitcoin’s life, it was unquestioned. When Satoshi Nakamoto released his creation into the world, digital currencies and blockchains were mere concepts, making Bitcoin the first real attempt at creating an asset that isn’t tied to traditional payment rails, or an underlying governmental system. But, many technologists and innovators have concluded that they can do better than what Satoshi has done, creating hundreds and thousands of spin-offs, better known as altcoins, in the process. And sadly enough, some of these cryptocurrency creators have taken to public forums to draw attention to Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, shunning the project that tacitly spawned their creation.  Brendan Blumer, the chief executive of the Hong Kong-based Block.one, the development group behind the EOS blockchain, recently took to the stage of the DC Blockchain Summit at the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CODC). While Blumer was on stage for a panel on blockchain’s applications in government, business, and other sectors, he brought up Bitcoin. And what he had to say wasn’t exactly cheery, nor did it sit well with the crypto public. The EOS co-creator did admit that he sees Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency and blockchain application, as entirely transformative, but that the network still has drastic shortcomings.  Blumer remarks that Bitcoin transactions, in actuality, cost well above the transaction fee stipulated by the miner market alone, with the actual cost of processing a peer-to-peer transfer potentially being as high as $50 to $100. In subsequent Twitter comments, Blumer continued this narrative. Trying to rationalize comment that BTC transactions actually cost more than the fee in and of itself, he drew attention to miner subsidies, explaining that this supply emission should actually account for the cost of securing processes. He then poked fun at Bitcoin’s transactional throughput and block times, explaining that to transfer BTC to a peer or business, it may take one hour, even if the “three transactions per second” limit isn’t already being satisfied. This, of course, is an exaggeration on Blumer’s end, as the widespread adoption of Segwit addresses allow for the network to process up to seven transactions per second, but his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin’s technical capabilities was made clear. While Blumer’s comments make it sound like he only sees a downside for Bitcoin in the future, his Twitter rebuttals make it clear that this isn’t exactly the case. In a tweet issued in mid-March, Blumer proudly proclaimed that he believes in the narrative that Bitcoin is the next coming of gold if you will — a digital store of value that has commodity-esque characteristics. In fact, he writes that he expects for the cryptocurrency to replace gold as the leading store of value over the next two decades, a sentiment held by the Winklevoss Twins, Willy Woo, Mike Novogratz, among other crypto industry stakeholders.  Responding to the critique he received for his monologue at CODC, he doubled-down on the idea that Bitcoin still has a valid, albeit relatively limited, value proposition. Blumer writes that he loves the world’s first cryptocurrency due to its potential to become the digital gold, but that it is inherently not optimized to compete in the realm of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other use cases. In other words, he is explaining that BTC transactions may be slow and relatively costly, but there’s enough space for both EOS and Bitcoin to exist in a decentralized, digital-based world. And that may just be how Satoshi Nakamoto wanted it. As Dan Held, the co-founder of Interchange, explained in an extensive Twitter thread, the Bitcoin creator likely had many chances to change the cardinal rules — 21 million supply limit, ten-minute blocks, one megabyte blocks, etc. — of his brainchild, but decided against it.",

        "passage": "This week, tech giant Microsoft and banking heavyweight JP Morgan announced a strategic partnership that will revolve around the duo boosting enterprise adoption of Morgan’s in-house private fork of Ethereum, Quorum. To do that, Microsoft is welcoming Quorum as the inaugural blockchain on its Azure cloud platform, specifically the new Azure Blockchain Service that the company launched on May 2nd. The new Azure arm will allow customers to leverage blockchain solutions in streamlined fashion. The adoption-focused meld will allow enterprises working with blockchain tech “to shift their focus from infrastructure management to application development, ultimately driving transformative business value,” the two companies said in their announcement.  It’s a win-win deal, of course. With Morgan’s Quorum now in Azure’s stable, Microsoft has advanced on its competitor Amazon, which launched its own Amazon Managed Blockchain service this past Tuesday. As for JP Morgan, its Quorum platform now has first-mover advantage in ushering in enterprise developers on Microsoft’s flagship blockchain service. JP Morgan blockchain head Umar Farooq hailed the collaboration as a milestone that would expand Quorum’s appeal: Microsoft has also committed to offering “engineering, consulting and go-to-market support for Quorum.” In extension, participating enterprises will be able to leverage the Azure Blockchain Workbench, which was launched last year and allows companies to readily build blockchain apps. It’s full steam ahead for JP Morgan’s blockchain, then, but whether it remains the bank’s blockchain could still be up in the air. One year ago the bank’s leadership was reportedly considering whether to spin-off or repurpose Quorum as an independent project in order to boost the platform’s prospects. The current strategic partnership isn’t the first time Microsoft has turned to Quorum, either. The tech giant teamed up with “Big Four” accounting firm EY to build the “Rights and Royalties” blockchain, a royalties system for Xbox game developers underpinned by JP Morgan’s Ethereum fork. If winning clients over is the name of the game, then Microsoft couldn’t have picked a better partner than JP Morgan to bootstrap the Azure Blockchain Service. Why? The bank is using Quorum to build out an interbank blockchain rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN), that is focused on streamlining banking transactions among its members. And speaking of members, the IIN has no shortage of them. That’s because the network already boasts more than 200 participating banks to date, all of which are accordingly becoming acquainted and using Quorum. That’s 200 plus possible clients that the Azure Blockchain Service can win over if these institutions continue to work with Quorum and want to build associated apps. The IIN is also set to grow, too, as the project is poised to begin trialing cross-border settlements (watch out Ripple!) later this year. If the trials prove fruitful, then the IIN’s numbers may eventually swell, making it so that more institutions will become familiar with Quorum. Back in February, when JP Morgan announced it was creating a stablecoin-like token dubbed JPM Coin, the aforementioned Farooq noted just how far the bank’s reach went regarding clientele: Microsoft would love to beat out Amazon in becoming the leading blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) choice among these markets — big corporations and major banks — and JP Morgan could be the ticket in actualizing that reality.",

        "passage": "If one of the fundamental factors driving the development of blockchain technology is to make the world a better, fairer and more transparent place, then leading charity Oxfam are keen to play their part. According to a recent publication in Cambodian newspaper The Khmer Times, Oxfam have just launched their very own blockchain project known as BlocRice. The concept behind the project is to provide the agriculture sector in developing nations with greater levels of power when it comes to negotiating sales with buyers. Moreover, it is also hoped that through the use of cryptocurrency tokens, the underlying supply chain will increase its scope.  BlocRice has decided to launch its first project in the South Asian state of Cambodia – a country that relies heavily on the exportation of agriculture products such as rice. In fact, in 2016 alone, the agriculture sector contributed more than 26.7 percent towards Cambodia’s GDP, subsequently resulting in the exportation of more than 542,000 tons of rice. The project was first rolled out in April 2017 as part of an initial pilot test, with the view of attempting to ascertain whether blockchain technology could ensure farmers sell their goods at a fair price. According to Solinn Lim,  director at Oxfam Cambodia, agricultural stakeholders will be required to engage with the blockchain-based contract, which if successful, will give farmers far more bargaining power than they are currently accustomed to. Furthermore, by utilizing the autonomous and immutable characteristics of smart contract technology, the project will bridge the gap between farmers, exporters and ultimately, purchasers of the rice that are based in the Netherlands. One such organization within the Netherlands that has already agreed to implement the technology is SanoRice, who primarily use Cambodian-based rice for the manufacturing of crackers. As a result, the entire end-to-end supply chain process can be tracked and management within the transparent blockchain protocol. On top of ensuring farmers from within developing nations receive a fair price on the goods they export, the BlocRice project also aims to introduce cashless payments. In collaboration with Acleda bank, the project will assist farmers in their attempt to reach banking services – something than many rural Cambodian regions are currently unable to access. Ultimately, if the process is labeled a success, it is hoped that BlocRice will be expanded not only to other developing nations, but across other agricultural products. This isn’t the first time that a global organization has utilized the benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology with the view of making the world a better place. Earlier this month we reported how Leading U.S. manufacturer SC Johnson – who primarily create goods linked to household cleaning products, are currently in the early stages of introducing blockchain technology to Indonesia.  The idea behind the project is to create an incentivization program that rewards locals for recycling their plastic waste. At present, Indonesia, along with other nations in the Asian region such as China, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, are responsible for more than 55% of the world’s plastic waste that is subsequently dumped in the ocean. By creating an incentivization system, those that choose to recycle are rewarded in the form of tokenization, which it is hoped can then be used to purchase goods and services.",

        "passage": "On April 25th, the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, the state’s top legal officer, declared it had successfully sued for an injunction order from the Manhattan Supreme Court against Bitfinex operators iFinex Inc. and tether (USDT) issuers Tether Limited.  Why? In their court filing, the NY AG alleged that last year Bitfinex lost $850 million USD worth of “comingled” company and client funds and thereafter participated in a cover-up by borrowing from the reserves of tether, a stablecoin, to obfuscate the loss.  The findings, which assert $700 million was discreetly borrowed from tether’s reserves, stem from an investigation campaign the NY AG’s office launched into cryptocurrency exchanges last fall. Bitfinex barred traders from the U.S. and New York in 2018, but Attorney General James has wide purview under the state’s Martin Act to defend New Yorkers who may still be using the platform anyways.  Per the court order, James’s office said Bitfinex’s operators and Tether Limited will be mandated to stop borrowing from tether’s reserves and to cease engaging in any potential cover-up activities while it continues to investigate the matters: The development spooked the cryptoeconomy, as market selloffs began hitting the top coins after word of the news spread. The bitcoin (BTC) price was down more than three percent, to $5,293, on the day; ether fared slightly worse, sinking closer to six percent in that span. Whether the episode will lead only to acute sell pressure remains to be seen. The massive $850 million loss in question apparently occurred after the funds became stuck for an as-yet undisclosed reason at Bitfinex’s external payments processor, the Panama-based Crypto Capital Corp (CCC). That dynamic caused Bitfinex customers’ withdrawals to grind down to a steady trickle, and internal communications revealed by the NY AG’s lawsuit show Bitfinex struggled to receive answers as to why CCC couldn’t move faster in processing the transactions. At one point, a Bitfinex employee told his CCC counterpart that the whole cryptoeconomy may suffer if CCC didn’t take definitive action, saying “BTC could tank below 1k if we don’t act quickly.” Not getting the answers they needed soon enough, Bitfinex’s operators — which are intimately linked with the leadership of Tether Limited — purportedly pivoted to tether’s reserves as an emergency stopgap instead. Bitfinex first turned to CCC for help in 2017 with the latter serving to facilitate Bitfinex customers’ fiat transactions. Notably, the Panamanian firm’s president at the time (and presumably still) was Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, a secretive executive who runs a sprawling network of offshore corporations per the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. Bitfinex has since responded to the NY AG’s court order by challenging the crux of the injunction.  To that end, the crypto exchange argued the CCC funds were, in fact, safe, and that the NY AG had been acting unduly: Bitfinex has given no word for now on what entity they assert is responsible for seizing those funds.",

        "passage": "Cryptocurrency is far from being the crowd pleaser, which explains why governments have taken regulatory strides to prohibit dealings with digital assets. While some countries have embraced the disruption that comes with virtual currencies, others are still on the adverse side of the technology. For Australia, however, the situation is ironic. The country was first crypto-friendly before anything else, doing as well as legalizing cryptocurrencies as a property in 2017.  Crypto exchanges were allowed to operate as long as they were registered under AUSTRAC, the country’s financial intelligence agency. Sadly, with the alarming rise of crypto-crimes in Australia, scammers are fueling the resolve of other anti-crypto countries to stand against cryptocurrencies and everything they represent. Crypto crimes like hacks and scams are not uncommon news in the cryptosphere, but it does begin to raise some brows when incessant news of said crimes come from one particular country. A report released by the ABC yesterday revealed that an Australian couple had lost over AU$20,000 (US$14,000) in a bitcoin scam, and that straw may as well have broken the proverbial camel’s back. Per the report, Nick and Josie Yeomans invested in a trading scheme that they discovered on Facebook, reportedly dubbed Coinexx.org (a name similar to Coinexx.com). The couple received a good return on their investment, enough to have them draw out funds to invest more – at which point the purported firm clamped down on the funds and even taunted the couple in a WhatsApp message. The Yeomans may be Australia’s latest victims, but they probably won’t be the last. In April, the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission revealed that cryptocurrency scams went up by 190% from the previous year, a wave that made Australian crypto users lose a total of $6.1 million Australian dollars ($4.3 million). Most of the victims were reined in with promises of forex trading access, commodity trading and other investment opportunities in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. Of the said 6.1 million AUD, a total of 2.6 million AUD was lost this way. Following this occurrence, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) made swift checks against suspicious websites and soon issued a warning to the Australian crypto community to steer clear of an alleged dubious entity dealing under two names, Dartalon Ltd and GFC Investments. The ASIC had released similar warnings previously, against suspicious Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and crypto-asset funds targeted at retail investors. The watchdog even stopped five different ICOs from raising capital since April 2018, claiming that they did not meet security standards required to run such businesses. ASIC followed by setting up MoneySmart – a website that investors could use for educating themselves on various financial matters before investing in ICOs. When crypto crimes happen, outsiders are quick to recommend that the affected bodies should take preventive measures rather than corrective ones. However, with Australia’s regulations and security provisions, both for retail investors and cryptocurrency exchanges, it is hard to apportion blame and responsibility. The growth of crypto crimes has since forced the Australian government to revise their stance towards cryptocurrency. In a June 20 article issued by the country’s Central Bank, it was declared that bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies would not be allowed as mainstream payments. “At the Australian level, there is definitely legitimate use for investment in cryptocurrencies, but we’re also seeing the use of them to facilitate tax crimes,” ATO deputy commissioner, Will Day had commented at the time. It is impossible to weigh the full impact of this restriction presently, but one thing is certain – if a previously crypto-friendly country like Australia draws back on their crypto relations, it may be harder for other crypto-averse countries to change their minds about the digital assets, seeing as their worst fears about them are coming true. In the long run, this cannot be good for the growth of the crypto sector globally.",

        "passage": "Last year, talk heated up around so-called “smart contract platform fragmentation.” Espoused by the likes of Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, the concept dealt with how competing smart contract platforms might respectively achieve popularity in different regions for various reasons. While the cryptoeconomy is still young, Ethereum has generally proven to be a bulwark against such fragmentation to date, having held its ground as the go-to smart contract platform thus far.  Of course, it’s not that interesting things aren’t happening on other platforms, or that platform fragmentation can’t still intensify. It’s just that Ethereum has established a network effect that seemingly grows into a bigger advantage every day. As of last month, Ethereum had approximately four times as many developers as the crypto ecosystem’s next largest development community, Bitcoin. Roughly speaking, that means almost 20 percent of all cryptocurrency developers are working around ETH. And some projects like Synthetix have walked back work on other platforms, in their case EOS, to work exclusively on Ethereum. It’s against this backdrop that Joel Monégro, a partner at cryptocurrency venture capital firm Placeholder, published on article on September 3rd dubbed “Ethereum and the Seven Dwarfs.” Therein, Monégro notably made a case for why the reigning smart contract platform was like tech giant IBM in the smart contract arena. The Placeholder partner started out by explaining the phrase “IBM and the Seven Dwarfs,” which was popularized decades ago to suggest just how far behind other computer makers of the day lagged behind IBM.  His point? Ethereum now seemingly finds itself in a similar dynamic, insofar as its network effect is so far out ahead of other networks presently. “Ethereum is the IBM of the smart contract blockchains: it may not be the ‘best’ technology, but it works well enough and has amassed a distribution advantage that will be hard to overcome by its competitors,” Monégro wrote near the start of his piece. The Placeholder partner later added: Monégro went on to say that such observations weren’t mean to be an ax against other projects, but rather merely that Ethereum seemed poised to keep its top position in the market “for at least the medium term,” like IBM did back in the day. People can agree or disagree on Monégro’s projection, to be sure. And Ethereum’s current “dwarfs” may go on to create great value for people just like many of IBM’s “dwarfs” did. But if Monégro’s aforementioned estimation bears out for the foreseeable future, it will have big implications for the newer wave of smart contract projects like Algorand, Cosmos, and Polkadot. Namely, it will entail the builders and communities of these fledgling networks continuously contending with Ethereum as a massive elelphant in the room. All projects have their own strategy for doing so. For example, Polkadot and Cosmos are heavily focusing on interoperability, which is important and useful work. But will the nuance be enough to bridge the gap with Ethereum’s lead? And does it matter? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s clear who’s king of the smart contract hill for now. “[W]hen it comes to the top, in terms of size, scale and impact, ETH looks a lot like the IBM of our era,” Monégro accordingly concluded his Tuesday piece.",

        "passage": "South Korea is suggesting that its northern counterpart is hacking computers to mine cryptocurrency and bring in extra revenue for the country. In addition, North Korea is also maliciously hacking South Korea and neighboring regions to potentially get its hands on confidential information. Recently, we reported that the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was responsible for roughly five separate cryptocurrency hacks in South Korea per data released by the cybersecurity firms Group-1B and Recorded Future.  About $882 million in cryptocurrency funds has been stolen throughout 2018, of which $571 million was allegedly taken by members of Lazarus. The organization has been blamed for attacks on digital exchanges like Yapizon, Coinrail and Bithumb, and virtually every attack’s financial loss exceeds $5 million. Lazarus was also blamed for the attack on Coincheck – one of Japan’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – in early January. Over half-a-billion in cryptocurrency funds disappeared overnight, and it’s likely the biggest disaster (and biggest embarrassment) suffered by Japan’s digital currency industry since Mt. Gox in 2014. The event set the precedent for new regulation in Japan regarding digital assets, and the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) saw themselves getting involved. The organization began sending notices out to the country’s many digital exchanges, warning them that if they didn’t step up their act and enable stronger security measures, they would ultimately be shut down. Coincheck has since begun initiating refunds for customers affected by the hack after facing considerable criticism for its hot wallet storage tactics. In recent news, a U.S. cybersecurity firm has come forth to explain that in January, it found computers installed with malware designed to mine the cryptocurrency Monero. The garnered funds later went to Kim II Sung University in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital city, suggesting the country was behind the malware’s implantation. The process is known as crypto-jacking, and involves malware being secretly downloaded onto an unsuspecting victim’s computer to use their energy as a means of extracting new coins. Although nothing new, it can have devastating effects on one’s power sources and run up a rather nasty bill for the person in question. The most recent scenario of crypto-jacking involves an Adobe Flash update that was allegedly very good at hiding its hidden mining code, as the software did exactly what it was designed to do. Users’ Adobe systems were updated, and thus no one ever suspected a thing. The malware was first noticed by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, named after a city in northern California. Over the years, cryptocurrency has emerged not only as a second form of income for North Korea, but also as a means of avoiding sanctions implemented by countries like the United States. Furthermore, the National Intelligence Service is saying that North Korea is preparing itself for a visit from international nuclear experts scheduled to examine the country’s Punggyeri nuclear test site. Leader Kim Jong Un invited journalists from all over the world to swing by and report on the dismantling of the site last May. The move is labeled a “major step towards denuclearization.” Now that the site has been removed, Jong Un is inviting the appropriate personnel to ensure the safety and low radiation levels of the dismantled operation. An intelligence officer familiar with the circumstances of the upcoming visit explains:",

        "passage": "According to a recent report, the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be one of the most significant barriers to mass adoption. Volatility, the report cites, causes individuals to not trust cryptocurrency as a long-term means of storing value. However, most respondents to the report cited an interest in owning cryptocurrencies if they did not already. Further, those that already own it have generally used it for purchases in the past.  Volatility is an issue that often comes up when discussing cryptocurrency. But what does it mean, exactly? Simply put, volatility is when something has an unstable price. Something like milk or eggs will typically have a relatively stable price that does not change quickly in a short amount of time. Prices will instead change slowly over the course of years or decades, which means goods like these have low volatility. High volatility, on the other hand, is what could be hampering cryptocurrency adoption. That’s when prices can swing massively either up or down in a matter of hours. As for what causes volatility, that’s a debate that can easily extend far beyond the scope of this article. But the most essential element is that if something is new, and a comparatively small number of people are seeking it, prices can swing much faster depending on sentiment and fear. For example, if a legal ruling comes down that suggests cryptocurrencies could face a crackdown, prices will plummet immediately. On the other hand, if a major bank or company announces that they’ll be getting involved in cryptocurrency, prices could jump up in response depending on how significant the announcement was. The report suggests that a large number of individuals are highly concerned about volatility. Specifically, approximately 90% of respondents claimed to “worry about volatility”, and 60% described volatility as an inconvenience. More than half of respondents cited volatility as the key reason behind their choice to not get involved in cryptocurrency. These issues aside, the report also dug into a few other interesting questions relating to cryptocurrency. Specifically, the report asked how respondents felt about there being a single world currency in place. This was met with a largely positive response, with around two thirds of respondents feeling such a development would be “beneficial to society.” Respondents reported feelings suggesting that a global currency would make it much more difficult if not impossible for a single country to manipulate the financial system as a whole for its own gains, such as by printing out more money or manipulating interest rates. Others reported that a global currency would “level the economic playing field for all countries” and make it easier for those of smaller nations to participate in the worldwide economy. While these points are interesting to consider, it does beg an obvious question – what would the ideal global currency be? One easy answer is bitcoin. Bitcoin would make an ideal instrument just because it is un-leveraged (meaning it is not a debt based asset like the US dollar is) and it is not minted or manipulated by any single entity. There would be many issues that would need to be overcome first such as scaling issues, transaction fees, and so on. But given enough time and investment, these issues could undoubtedly be fixed. As for whether or not the world would benefit from having a single currency, that’s an entirely different debate. One popular trend recently in the cryptocurrency world is stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that do their best to implement a system where they will have as little volatility as possible. Some examples include USDT and MakerDAO. Both of which have seen reasonable amounts of success and have generally kept their goal of having a far more stable price than other digital assets. While stablecoins can be handy for high-frequency traders and other situations, a stablecoin as we know it today would be far from ideal for a global currency.  Read: What are Stablecoins? The reason for this is simple. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoins are created by groups or companies with the intent of making a profit. Not only that, but these groups also typically retain the ability to create and destroy units of their currency at will. In the case of USDT, Tether has been known to mint hundreds of millions of new units at a time based upon the claim that they have added an equal amount of US dollars to their reserves. However, Tether is, by their own admission, completely unable to be audited based on the way their business is designed. It goes without saying that these types of stable coins can in many cases be very easily manipulated by their creators. Further, the motivations behind the creators are clear. And that is to make a profit. A non-biased and completely decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin or something similar would be a far better solution. You may argue that bitcoin, due to its volatility issues, is far from a preferable global currency. This assumption is based on the suggestion that bitcoin prices will continue to be volatile even if the digital asset sees billions of users each day. The truth is, if bitcoin were to one day become a major global currency (whether it be the only one or not), it would become far less volatile over time as its demand or lack thereof would stabilize, and so would prices. So to sum up the volatility debate, the volatility we are seeing today is undoubtedly scaring off a lot of would-be bitcoin users. However, volatility also represents an opportunity for traders, and as adoption grows, lower volatility will undoubtedly come with it.",

        "passage": "Crypto-related crime has struck again; this time in Jaipur, India, but thankfully the long arm of the law caught up with the perpetrators before they could do much damage. Indian police have reportedly uncovered the den of kidnappers who had held two Bitcoin traders captive for two weeks. Per the report, the two Bitcoin traders, Luftan Shaikh, and Mohammad Shazad had been kidnapped alongside and another individual named Malang Shah.  According to the Indian Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikas Sharma, the gang of seven had been demanding 80 bitcoins (about 8 crores and $848,720 at current market price) from the family of the traders. “The gang kidnapped Shaikh and Shazad, two bitcoin traders, and demanded 80 bitcoins worth ₹8 crore. Shah was kidnapped two days later. The gang demanded ₹10 lakh from his family members,” said Sharma. Sharma revealed that the gang’s nefarious activities were first suspected when a man in the neighborhood was found loitering with a pistol at around 2:30 am on Sunday. After apprehension and questioning, the criminal the police to the rest of his team, who had been torturing the captured trio on the ninth floor of an 11-story building. The gang is suspected to be connected to some other crimes including various kidnappings, robbery, extortion, and loot cases. While it is impressive that the Indian police caught up with this set of criminals and rescued the captives, this case is one victory in a sea of vanquished crypto-related ransom cases. Other reported kidnaps that requested for the ransom to be paid in cryptocurrency ended in less than happy notes. For as long as cryptocurrency has been deemed valuable, kidnappers and other criminals have taken a sick affinity to the coin. This does not come as a surprise, mainly because cryptocurrency transactions offer a degree of anonymity that sufficiently covers the criminal’s tracks, but thankfully, not all the time. Even crypto’s anonymity cannot cover up for criminals with slow brains- as is often the case. In September 2018, Costa Rican news outlets reported the kidnap of American businessman William Sean Creighton, and the subsequent demand for a $5 million ransom paid in cryptocurrency. Creighton’s family could only pay $1 million,  and wait for the return of their relative. Sadly, Creighton was never released- and is still declared missing till now, and is presumed dead. The kidnappers were apprehended, as their IP address was flagged after they tried to convert the crypto funds to fiat. Anonymity could only see them so far– but sadly Creighton could not be rescued. Last year also, Norwegian Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen was abducted outside her home in Oslo. Elisabeth was wife to one of Norway’s richest men, Tom Hagen, so the kidnappers must have deemed it fit to ask for the $10 million ransom that they did, to be paid in cryptocurrency. Hagen paid the ransom, but his wife was never released. In fact, subsequent reports are speculating that she may never be released, and was possibly murdered. It is hard to say. Anonymity is one of the most distinguishing attributes of cryptocurrency, and if that is lost, crypto might as well cease to exist. However, the fact that crypto is crime-plagued does not make it any more of a dark tool than fiat. Fiat is also used for heinous crimes all over the world, and it does not even need anonymity to do it. While this is not an explanation that washes cryptocurrency of the mud that criminals have rolled it in, it does suffice to keep the pot from calling the kettle black.",

        "passage": "Blockchain technology is catching on in an area that is a far cry from FinTech. According to a recent report from Accenture, more than 85% of aerospace and defense companies are expecting to use blockchain in their businesses by 2021. Aviation may not seem like a natural fit for DLT, but it offers some advantages for an industry that needs to keep strict records for safety reasons. John Schmidt, who is Accenture’s managing director of aerospace and defense, told Aviation Week that, “It’s very rare that we talk about something two years in a row but this technology is taking off much faster than we thought it would,” and that, “Another interesting industry statistic is the number of companies already working with blockchain – not necessarily having a system installed but working with the concept. More than half of them are working with the technology today.”  Private blockchains are a great new tool for businesses that need to make sure their records are secure, and precise. Unlike blockchains that use proof-of-work to validate transactions, private blockchains are operated via a server or network that doesn’t rely on mining to incentivize the blockchain’s operation. Some have compared private blockchain technology to a regular shared database, but the inability to alter blocks once they are created is a new benefit that fits into the aviation industry perfectly. Mr. Schmidt expanded on this aspect of blockchain technology, “It (blockchain) also helps us be in a better position to create the feedback loop from what we’re seeing in the asset, its life and its usage to put back into engineering,” and that, “This can then be used to enable changes to better improve the asset’s life.” Aircraft maintenance is a vital part of making sure that planes are safe to operate, and blockchain-based records could help airlines make sure there weren’t any oversights that are potentially dangerous. Blockchain can be used to track everything that happens to major parts of an aircraft, like the engine, so that any problems have a better chance of being detected. Earlier this week Accenture confirmed they would be working with Thales at Farnborough to create a blockchain platform to establish more confidence in supply chains. They plan to use blockchain in order to create a secure record of every part that is used in an aircraft’s construction. Any issues would be easier to track down, across the entire indutry. This is more or less the same idea that the IBM Food Trust operates under, which illustrates the utility of blockchain’s capabilities in numerous vital industries. Gazpromneft-Aero, who operates of the Gazprom Neft aviation refueling business is working with S7 Airlines and Siberia Airlines to use a blockchain-based smart-contract system for aviation fuel payments. The group calls the new kind of contract Aviation Fuel Smart Contracts, or just AFSCs for short. The Deputy CEO for Logistics, Refining and Sales at Gazprom Neft, Anatoly Cherner, thinks that, “The development and implementation of digital services like this is an important element in creating a digital platform for managing the logistics, processing and sale of oil products at Gazprom Neft. Implementing digital transformation projects in cooperation with major partners will enable the company to reach a new level in technological and operational efficiency, right now,” according to a statement released after the program was announced. When AFSCs were announced they were the first commercial use of blockchain technology in the Russian market, and have helped the participants cut down on all the hassles connected with the airline fuel payment system. Blockchain appears to be a better system for numerous applications, which offers significant improvements over existing database technologies. The aviation industry is another early adopter of a technology that appears to bring numerous advantages to the table.",

        "passage": "As the specter of cryptocurrencies grows in regulatory circles across the globe, some policymakers are taking steps to go to war with anonymous cryptocurrency use. Their aim? To stem the tide of assets that can power commerce outside of the state’s purview. The latest flex against anonymous and psuedonymous cryptocurrency use comes from Texas, where State Representative Phil Stephenson has introduced a draft bill that, if passed by the Texas legislature and signed into law by the state governor, would stringently mandate the deanonymization of Texan crypto users.  The unprecedented bill, H.B. No. 4371, is tentatively titled as “relating to digital currencies.” The legislation would enforce that all enterprises in the state validate the identity of customers paying via cryptocurrency.  Alternatively, identities need not be validated if customers pay with a so-called verified identity digital currency (VIDC). One relevant portion of the bill, Sec. 662.0002, reads: Per Rep. Stephenson’s definition of terms, a VIDC would be a “digital currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known before a person has access to another person’s digital wallet.” General Counsel for Athena Blockchain and NYU professor Drew Hinkes noted on Twitter that it’s unclear if any cryptocurrencies would presently qualify as VIDCs per H.B. 4371. Hinkes also threw into question what amount or kinds of identification would satisfy the draft bill’s requirements.  In that same thread, Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research at non-profit cryptocurrency research and advocacy group Coin Center, said the bill was “very oddly drafted” and suggested its language betrayed a lack of understanding in “how digital currencies work.”  For now, it’s too early in the process to have any indication as to whether H.B. 4371 will pass or not. But its introduction is notable insofar as it marks the first time a bill of its thrust has been put forward in any of the 50 U.S. states. Only time will tell if legislators in other parts of the country follow suit in putting forward similar bills. Rumblings of a privacy-focused crackdown in France’s nook of the cryptoeconomy have taken shape over the last few weeks after the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, the country’s lower parliamentary house, issued a report in which the body said a ban on anonymizing cryptocurrencies had been worth considering. “It would […] have been appropriate to propose a ban on the dissemination and trade in [privacy coins that] ensure complete anonymity by preventing any identification procedure by design,” the committee president said. The report hailed privacy coin stalwarts like Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), and PIVX as likely candidates for such a ban. Like H.B. 4371, though, it remains to be seen whether the committee’s suggestion will lead to any further policy traction in the Western European powerhouse. The Texas draft bill is something of an outlier, as a handful of American states have recently been taking pro-crypto legislative strides to accommodate, not crackdown, on the cryptoeconomy. Arguably the most high-profile of these states has been Wyoming, which has moved forward on more than a dozen crypto-friendly bills this year.  Other states like Utah, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Arizona have also seen fresh permissive approaches to cryptocurrencies as of late. Since there have been no federal crypto laws passed in the U.S. so far, states have necessarily had to take the lead toward the ecosystem, and some are doing so much more liberally than others.",
