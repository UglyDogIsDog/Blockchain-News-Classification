        "passage": "Canaan, Inc. – the Hangzhou-based mega-seller of cryptocurrency mining equipment – has allowed its application for a Hong Kong IPO to lapse. The IPO would have been worth a record $400 million, and the lapse casts doubt on the futures of other bitcoin mining gear providers. The application “ran out of steam” on Thursday, November 15, 2018 – approximately six months after it was originally filed. Despite bitcoin’s massively slumping price, optimism has rung true throughout the cryptocurrency space as of late, suggesting the IPO likely would have been met with success. Unfortunately, it appears things were not meant to be.  At the same time, however, Canaan’s original prospects for the IPO were slated to be $2 billion, and the sudden drop to $400 million (a drop of more than three-quarters) suggests a lackluster outcome for those involved. Many regulators ultimately had questions surrounding the IPO’s business model and prospects. In addition, some sources are claiming that the IPO was never set to take place this year based on updates from the Hong Kong stock exchange regarding a listing hearing. Canaan is now in a position where it can refile its IPO application granted executives update it with the proper financial data. This is the only way for the IPO considerations to continue. Along with Canaan, two other mining equipment giants – Bitmain Technologies and Ebang – also have IPO applications being considered by the Hong Kong stock exchange. However, Ebang’s listing isn’t likely to go public until 2019 or later. Bitmain, on the other hand, is undergoing a “massive interrogation” by the stock exchange and the Securities and Future Commission (SFC), answering questions and hoping to get an official stamp of approval soon.  Read: What is Bitmain? The pause in Canaan’s plans is coming just weeks after the SFC claimed it would be reexamining its regulations surrounding virtual currencies. However, it appears specific licensing requirements are now being forced upon financial firms that either manage or intend to manage investor portfolios containing cryptocurrencies, and the SFC is not considering whether these currencies classify as futures or securities. Stephen Chan – partner at the law firm Dechert LLP – claims that this is mainly due to the volatility and price swings witnessed in virtual assets, and that the SFC is only looking to protect customers. He comments: The prospects of future regulations are weighing heavily on the cryptocurrency space. Canaan, for example, has worked hard to present itself to authorities not so much as a bitcoin company, but rather as a chip designer looking to establish itself in other technological venues such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like regulators are taking the bait. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading for approximately $5,500 – its lowest price in about one year. A widespread slump began last Wednesday, November 14, and has taken a nasty toll on several digital assets thus far. An anonymous senior equity capital markets banker not directly involved in any of the ongoing IPO applications recently stated that both the Hong Kong stock exchange and the SFC had several concerns regarding the IPO projects at hand. He states: If bitcoin continues to drop even further, one can probably expect further delays regarding the IPO applications, bitcoin ETF applications, and other major moves to legitimize the digital asset arena.",

        "passage": "Singapore is rapidly becoming a global blockchain development hotspot. In addition to being home to a thriving community of blockchain start-ups, Singapore’s central bank (The Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS) has declared that blockchain is a “fundamental” technology.  While speaking at Consensus: Singapore Damien Pang, the head of technology infrastructure MAS, said that, There are few other places in the world that have created such an open legal framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency. Singapore has also been a big beneficiary of China’s love/hate relationship with cryptos. China has recently made an about-face in terms of blockchain policy, but Beijing is still very negative on cryptocurrency in general.  Read: PBoC-Backed Ping An Blockchain Trade Finance Platform Goes Live 57 blockchain-focused projects in Singapore raised more than $570 million USD via ICOs in the second quarter of this year, which compares with just 14 projects based in Hong Kong that brought in $47.6 million USD. Singapore breaks digital assets into three groups: payment tokens, utility tokens, and securities. While onstage at Consensus: Singapore, Damien Pang made it a point to mention that the MAS has no plans to regulate utility tokens, but they will introduce a payment service law for payment tokens by the end of 2018. The MAS has already teamed up with Singapore’s stock exchange and three other partners to create a digital token settlement system that will be blockchain-based. Called “Project Ubin”, the program will likely help Singapore cement its position as a global crypto hub. The talent pool for blockchain development is pretty tight at the moment. With limited human resources, Singapore is potentially creating a blockchain development culture that will be difficult to challenge. Once talented people have access to a well-regulated economy, and easy development capital, it isn’t likely they will stray too far from their home. Unlike China or the USA, Singapore is moving quickly to establish a reliable legal framework for digital assets, which will help companies to invest confidently in the nation-state. China’s crackdown on one of the world’s most promising new technologies has driven companies like imToken, Bitmain and Huobi to open regional headquarters there. Singapore offers major advantages for companies that need access to both new technology and established banking infrastructure. As a global banking hub, they can give blockchain start-ups an upper hand in a sector that is probably going to revolutionize the financial industry. Leading blockchain PR firm Wachsman just announced they would be opening up their first Asian office, in Singapore of all places. They are planning on expanding their current staff, and will probably help some of Singapore’s blockchain start-ups to spend some of the money they have been pulling in. The firm’s founder and CEO, David Wachsman, said this via a press release about their new venture, Wachsman has plans to beef-up its staff globally over the next few years as well. Their business could be viewed as a barometer of how much the blockchain industry has expanded over the last few years. David Wachsman began the firm back in 2015, and was the only employee. Now they have offices in Dublin, New York, and soon, Singapore.",

        "passage": "Australia’s cryptocurrency tax laws contain some unfair provisions that will most often put crypto owners on the receiving end of huge tax burdens. These draconian tax laws also apply to tokens obtained via hard forks which has holders having to cough up substantial amounts in crypto tax payments. Even companies that pay staff salaries in virtual currencies may find little incentive to do so given the additional burden it incurs at the end of the year.  According to Australian cryptocurrency news platform Micky, a cryptocurrency holder was forced to pay a 500% tax on his digital holdings. Adrian Forza of Crypto Tax Australia told Micky that the country’s tax law stipulates that the value of cryptocurrency used for tax purposes comes from the purchase price. Thus, if an investor buys token X at $100 and the price depreciates to $10, the tax payment would be based on the $100 purchase price. Crypto tax in Australia stands at about 40% so that would mean paying a $40 tax on $10 worth of virtual currency. Commenting on the situation, Forza declared: Given the 2018 bear market that saw prices plummet by more than 80 percent across the board, virtual currency bag holders in Australia must have been made to pay unfair taxes. Usually, crypto tax laws for countries with such make it desirous to hold cryptocurrency for a long period of time. It is only in trading and making purchases that incur substantial tax implications. Forza also shed some light on other ridiculous provisions in Australia’s cryptocurrency tax regime. For one, the Australia Taxation Office (ATO) considers Ethereum Classic (ETC) to be the “original Ethereum” even though the cryptocurrency industry at large considers Ethereum (ETH) to be the original and ETC the fork. The implication of this tax ruling is that ETH holders have to pay capital gains tax on 100% of their ether holdings since the ATO considers the purchase price to be zero. Here is where the ATO appears to be disingenuous because when it comes to forks, it considers tokens obtained during the chain split to be bought as zero price. Thus, when tax season comes around, holders have to consider the current price. Another ridiculous tax law is one that subjects companies that pay employees in cryptos to “fringe benefits tax” to the tune of 47% on every dollar paid. This extra cost burden is most likely to disincentivize companies from paying their staff in bitcoin and other virtual currencies – a move which greatly hampers adoption. Since the ATO flipflops on when crypto should be valued for tax, it would be better to create a situation where holders can offset their losses during a bear market against the gains earned during the previous boom market. That way, the entire tax framework doesn’t become obscenely burdensome on cryptocurrency owners and traders. Another pain point is the refusal of the ATO to consider a fiat-in, fiat-out paradigm for its crypto taxation. Speaking to Micky, Jonathan Carley of DigitalX – a blockchain-based startup said that ATO will not adopt such a policy. These anti-crypto tax laws could severely damage the advancement of virtual currencies in the country. Crypto and blockchain technology continue to be a popular emerging market down under with exchanges like Zebpay moving to the country. Around the world, governments appear to be paying greater attention to crypto taxation especially with the current bull market in the hopes of earning internal revenue from traders. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says clear cut regulations are imminent.",

        "passage": "Filecoin and Coda Protocol are unrelated projects in the blockchain arena. What they have in common is big backers and the status of having their respective mainnets, or live networks, not yet online. Yet — in what’s already proven to be a busy week for cryptoeconomy headlines — both upstarts have made fresh announcements that reveal each is respectively making strides toward bringing their mainnets online.  Where these projects will eventually settle in the wider blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem is an open question. But their builders are making the moves needed now to set these platforms up for potential success later. Filecoin, the decentralized storage network created by the Protocol Labs team, is being created to let users exchange unused storage space through an open marketplace. And stakeholders in the project now have a target launch date for its mainnet: spring 2020. That’s per a new Filecoin update this week, in which the project estimated its testnet launch would come on December 11th, 2019, and its mainnet activation would happen in March 2020. The Filecoin team noted these dates could be changed later, but they offer a general roadmap forward for now. “The most important news in this update is that we’re getting very close to launching the network,” Filecoin said.  The project, which counts among its investors Y Combinator and Winklevoss Capital, is being built as an incentive layer atop the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), itself a decentralized data storage solution built by Protocol Labs. Filecoin will be comprised of blockchain and will have a native token, filecoin, that will be used in its storage transactions. The materializing project is known in the cryptocurrency space for having conducted one of the most lucrative token offerings in 2017, a year when initial coin offering (ICO) buzz reached feverish proportions. Facilitated through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) model, the Filecoin ICO raised $205 million USD at the time. These SAFTs can be redeemed once the network’s mainnet is activated. Recently, Coinbase noted filecoin tokens were among a host of new projects the popular cryptocurrency exchange was considering adding support for. This week, O(1) Labs — the development company behind the “tiny blockchain in your browser” Coda Protocol project — announced they had enlisted the help of two influential industry experts to help make the succinct blockchain a reality. Specifically, O(1) Labs has just established its so-called Testnet Advisory Board and has added Luke Youngblood and Zaki Manian to the group’s ranks as technical advisors. The body will be responsible for generally advancing the development of the Coda Protocol. Hired by Coinbase earlier this year, Youngblood is known in cryptocurrency circles for being a key figure behind the launch of Tezos, as the engineer built out the staking infrastructure for the network on behalf of the Tezos Foundation. “I’m excited about the potential of Coda to enable developers to build truly decentralized apps,” Youngblood said. For his part, Zaki Manian is Head of Research at Tendermint, the team behind the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Now, he and Youngblood will help steer Coda Protocol on its own path toward fruition. “The Testnet Advisory Board will allow us to iterate even more quickly towards a mainnet candidate,’ noted Evan Shapiro, co-founder and chief executive officer at O(1) Labs, in welcoming the new advisors. It’s been full steam ahead for the project so far in 2019. Back in April, O(1) Labs announced a $15 million fundraising round that saw investments from Coinbase Ventures and beyond. “Over the next few months, we’ll be inviting users to become more deeply involved with Coda,”O(1) Labs said at the time.",

        "passage": "Ripple’s annual Swell conference in San Francisco featured a keynote address from former U.S. President Bill Clinton this year, and he had some kind words for blockchain technology.  During a post-keynote discussion with former economic advisor Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton said that, “This whole blockchain deal has the potential it does only because it is applicable across national borders (and) income groups. The permutations and possibilities are staggeringly great.” The former President also dived into other issues that the world is facing, saying that socioeconomic policies, “work better as positive sum games.” Unlike politically loaded central banks, cryptocurrencies are truly nationless and very resistant to political pressure. The recent introduction of a European interbank clearing mechanism that circumvents SWIFT is a great example of how far politics have penetrated the financial system. Bill Clinton seemed to pick up on widening schisms between long-time allies, and warned that, “We could ruin it all by negative identity politics and economic and social policy. You think about that.” The political gulfs that are emerging in developed nation are serious, but the lack of political will to find holistic solutions to global problems has been even more apparent recently. Cryptocurrencies offer global citizens a whole new way to do business. The hurdles that an ordinary person faces in the world of banking shouldn’t be understated. In many cases the population in an emerging economy is forced to remain in the unregulated cash economy, whether or not they want to use banks. In places like Indonesia, the costs involved with opening and maintaining a bank account price the vast majority of the population out of the banking market. Not only does this make simple things like sending money far more expensive and time consuming, any sort of loans are out of the question. Cryptos can be used to trade in very small amounts of value at nearly no cost. Numerous exchange platforms like CoinCola and Pundi X are working to bring some level of financial services to “unbankable” populations globally. Their platforms make trading cryptos easier, which enables the global poor to exit the cash economy, and gain access to a much higher level of financial services. Ripple’s platform is basically aimed at making interbank transactions far more efficient. Until a week or two ago, the only interbank transfer system that had a global reach was SWIFT. Now that the EU may have designed a system that would allow EU based financial entities to trade with US-blacklisted companies or nations, there could be another system in place that could be used instead of SWIFT. At this point there is no technical impediment to eliminating slow, archaic systems like SWIFT, other than the regulations that exist in most nations for banks. In some countries, like Thailand and Singapore, cryptos and blockchain now have an effective regulatory structure. In the USA, crypto regulations are moving at a much slower pace. Last week the U.S. Congress asked Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how his agency plans to regulate cryptos via a letter. There has been no word from the SEC yet, but in some cases, people are being prosecuted in the USA under SEC code for bogus ICOs. Case law is a far cry from effective regulations, which is exactly what would allow large-scale blockchain and crypto development to move forward in the USA. Ripple has recently helped to form a new lobbing group that will work to help the US government in their efforts to create supportive crypto regulations. They also just launched their xRapid platform, which would make fiat-to-fiat transfers simple. Of course, the potential profit for a platform like xRapid is enormous, even if it only costs a fraction of what a SWIFT transfer costs. Ripple looks like it is in a good position, and given the fact they were able to land Bill Clinton for their conference, they might be very successful in Washington D.C.",

        "passage": "As Starbucks shops are preparing for the integration of Bakkt, the famous coffee shop’s customers will have the opportunity to pay for their favorite coffee with bitcoin (BTC); however, tax returns might represent a serious problem to the functionality of the crypto-based payment system. The point of mass adoption in terms of accepting cryptocurrencies as alternative payment methods across various retail shops comes down to the case of spending your digital assets as quickly as fiat.  In the meanwhile, many shops started to accept bitcoin alongside several cryptocurrencies, but the mass adoption is yet to bring the cryptos to mainstream as the majority of businesses accepting crypto as an alternative payment method are said to be small and medium companies. This case might soon see serious changes as Starbucks most recently received significant equity in Bakkt, although the coffee giant is not holding any cash investments in this cryptocurrency ecosystem. As reported by The Block, Starbucks is currently working on designing and developing an application and a card that will allow the coffee magnum to become “Bakkt’s first merchant-on-platform”. Initially, only the customers based in the United States will be able to use bitcoin to cover their coffee bill at Starbucks. The equity stake was issued after the partnership between Starbucks and Bakkt was made official, while Starbucks agreed to allow bitcoin-based payments in return. The partnership announcement was in the meanwhile postponed as the companies were waiting for the decision from CFTC.  However, although the recent partnership with Bakkt brought bitcoin to Starbucks as one of the available payment methods, the famous chain of coffee shops doesn’t actually accept direct deposits in BTC, which means that during the payment, BTC is being exchanged to US dollars as enabled by Bakkt software. In this case scenario the most significant obstacle is the fact that this type of payment processing mechanism calls for tax reporting for the coffee you are buying, which is why some Twitter users are reminding crypto enthusiasts that all Starbucks customers paying with bitcoin will be required to count the capital gains on every cup of coffee bought with BTC.  Although the coffee giant is making a step that could be categorized as a significant leap towards the mainstream adoption of bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies likewise, Starbucks customers who wish to pay for their coffee with bitcoin might face some difficulties due to the tax reporting. Back in 2014, the IRS published guidance on the subject of cryptocurrency where it is clearly stated that virtual currencies are to be treated as property, while all generalities included in the principle on paying taxes on the property will likewise be applicable on cryptocurrency-based transactions. That means that every time a customer would pay for their coffee in bitcoin, they would need to take the price of BTC at the time of the purchase then compare it to the price of bitcoin at the time of the filing taxes to calculate capital gains and losses. Just as capital losses can be redeemed through tax filings, capital gains on the coffee purchases also need to be covered within taxation, which makes bitcoin-based purchases at Starbucks perhaps a bit too much to handle for an average crypto enthusiast craving for a latte.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin, like the Internet, is arguably a neutral technology, letting anyone, anywhere access its blockchain. However, one prominent futurist — the chief executive of a major technology firm — has argued that the cryptocurrency is inherently “bad for humanity”. Here’s why.  Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of major cloud computing and virtual machine company VMWare, recently sat down with Fortune to talk Bitcoin. Contrary to what his technology background may suggest, Gelsinger asserted that he isn’t a fan of the cryptocurrency, bashing what he believes is a high level of energy consumption for the utility it provides to humanity. In fact, he suggested that it is contributing to the ongoing “climate crisis” that many scientists and politicians actively discuss: Indeed, from the perspective of an outsider, Bitcoin seems to be only hurting the environment. A website from researchers at the University of Cambridge revealed earlier this year that the miners backing the Bitcoin network consume more than seven gigawatts of electricity. Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt-hours of energy consumption. This amounts to about 0.25% of the world’s annual electricity consumption, which, for an asset seemingly only used by the fringe, seems quite crazy. However, CoinShares estimates that a majority of Bitcoin miners are powered by renewable, green energy sources. In a 19-page report released late last year, the crypto investment and research firm, claimed that renewable energy makes 77.6% of total Bitcoin mining, citing the concentration of renewable energies in areas where Bitcoin miners are, namely China, Iceland, the west coast of the U.S., and the west coast of Canada. They followed this estimate up this year by claiming that some 75% of Bitcoin mining is renewable. Other sources have verified these claims. In a post for HackerNoon, Robert Sharratt, a former employee of the Natural Resources & Power Group, wrote that Bitcoin is primarily powered by Chinese hydro electricity: The “Bitcoin is killing the Earth” narrative wasn’t the only one that Gelsinger utilized. He added in the Fortune interview that he believes Bitcoin is primarily used for illicit activities, and is thus “bad for humanity”. Gelsinger’s comment is quite reminiscent of those made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and other world leaders over recent weeks. As reported by Blockonomi previously, Pompeo told CNBC last week that the anonymous/pseudonymous transactions that cryptocurrencies can enable do pose a security threat or “risk” to America and its allies. The Trump advisor went on to cite 9/11, invoking the terrorist attack to paint a narrative that this new class of digital payment networks may not be conducive to the safety of humanity. They aren’t exactly wrong. The New York Times recently came out with a lengthy post about how Hamas is using Bitcoin to fund operations. Also, Ciphertrace found that cryptocurrency crime is a multi-billion dollar industry. However, it is important to point out that there are many using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle or as a way to hedge against the fiat system, which may be hurting them. Just look to Cyprus a number of years ago, when Bitcoin spiked in the midst of a seemingly inhumane crackdown on banks.",

        "passage": "On Wednesday, Mark Yusko, founder, and partner at Morgan Creek Capital Management, made an appearance at CNBC: Fast Money, where he laid out his claim that Bitcoin is a much better investment option than traditional stocks as of this point. Yusko is actually quite popular in the stock industry, particularly for correctly predicting the sell-off in stock that occurred in 2018. In this interview, he expressed his belief that the stock market is already witnessing another bear market, and things could get considerably worse as time goes on. As a result, he went on to endorse Bitcoin (BTC) as a surer investment portfolio at the moment.  Speaking on his conclusion, he added, “I even wear my Bitcoin tie today for you guys. I was on this show back in December when it was $3100, and you said, ‘What do you think?’ I said, ‘Look. We’ve issued the Morgan Creek Digital crypto challenge, we will take Bitcoin over the next 10 years, starting on January 1st, and we will take anybody who wants to take the other side.’ It was a $1 million charity bet, just like the Buffett style bet. We got no takers.” The bet that Yusko was referring to is the “Buffett Bet 2.0,” which was issued by Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, his partner at Morgan Creek Capital, last year. While speaking with CNBC in December, Pompliano announced the challenge, saying that he was willing to wager $1 million on the fact that Morgan Creek’s basket of digital assets would outperform the S&P 500 over ten years, starting from January 1, 2019. He famously invited anyone who was willing to stand on the other side of such a bet, saying that it would most likely be someone bullish on the S&P 500, or who believes that cryptocurrencies are worthless. In the latest interview, Yusko went on to point out that not taking that bet turned out to be the best thing for any would-be takers, as “while BTC is already up over 100 percent this year, the S&P is only up 14 percent.” Yusko’s comments were surely not wrong. BTC held a price of $3,744 as of January 1, while its unit price at press time is pegged at $7,601. That’s an increase of 103 percent (according to data from CoinMarketCap). On the flip side, the S&P 50 closed at 2,510 points on January 1, while the closing value as at May 22 was 2,856, marking a growth rate of 13.8 percent since the turn of the year (per data from the CNBC Index). If you thought about betting against Pomp, you’d be pretty much in the hole already. After pointing out this disparity, Yusko added, “I think going forward from here, even over the next year, over the next 10 years, it’s not going to be close. Bitcoin is a great diversifying asset, it has a very low correlation, it should be in anybody’s portfolio.” Pompliano recently had to come out to make a point about cryptocurrencies. Last Tuesday, he was a guest on CNBC’s Squawk Box, where he engaged in a somewhat heated argument with Kevin O’Leary, chairman of investment firm O’Shares ETFs O’Leary wasted no time in trashing Bitcoin, going as far as calling is “garbage” and “useless.” Despite the noticeable uptick in its prices last week, Bitcoin didn’t seem to impress the investor. He questioned the value of Bitcoin, claiming that it is “basically a digital game” without any intrinsic value. In his defense, Pompliano pointed out that that Bitcoin was going through a bit of a rough start, just as it is with every other disruptive technology in the world. He added that currencies work with a “belief system,” and BTC is functioning as money. “So, for the US dollar, the only reason you and I use it is because we believe it has value. So I give you a dollar, and you give me a good or service in exchange. Bitcoin has value because the two people who exchange it believe it has value. And what we’re seeing is the volume, look at people using it,” he confirmed.",

        "passage": "To most in the crypto community, mainstream media is viewed with intense skepticism.  Most of these attacks come from mainstream outlets, from CNBC and Forbes to the New York Post and Bloomberg. For instance, one Bloomberg op-ed headline published in January 2018 reads: “Sorry, Bitcoin Fans. Digital Currency Is Still a Dream.” But, Bitcoin and its devout followers may have found a mainstream media “inside man”, so to speak, that is heading one of CNBC’s top shows.  The anchor’s name is Joe Kernen, a panelist and showrunner at CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, the station’s morning Wall Street show. Ever since Facebook’s unveiled Libra, their soon-to-launch pseudo-centralized stablecoin, Kernen has come to an understanding of Bitcoin almost like he has had some sort of epiphany. It all started last week, which was when the “Squawk Box” correspondents began to cover news of the Silicon Valley-backed cryptocurrency. As many were claiming that this was a “cryptocurrency”, Kernen rebutted. The television star questioned Libra’s “inherent value”, discussing the fact that it will just be based on the United States Dollar and similar assets in that class. Kernen even hinted at his mistrust of fiat monies, noting that the only thing backing paper currencies is the governments and central banks, then adding that the European Union leaders have begun to debase (inflate) the Euro. And to put a cherry on the proverbial Bitcoin cake, he made the argument that a “real Bitcoin” may have more value than Libra due to the former’s decentralized blockchain.  Following the airing of this segment, Crypto Twitter, including many prominent executives and commentators, quickly lauded Kernen. Due to his newfound knowledge of cryptocurrency, Kernen continued his Bitcoin crusade the day later. After briefly calling himself a “Bitcoin bull” and a “god” of sorts, the Squawk Box personality quipped: On Monday, Kernen took the time to bash Libra for the umpteenth time. After Bart Smith of Susquehanna laid out his thoughts on why Libra isn’t a cryptocurrency, the “Squawk Box” host then said something that was music to the ears of cypherpunks across the globe. Sounding like a Satoshi Nakamoto excerpt, Kernen explained that Libra is a currency for corporations, but Bitcoin is a currency built and used by “the people”. This small yet notable comment confirms, according to Barry Silbert, that Kernen has entered the “five phases of Bitcoin acceptance”: dismissive, skeptical, intellectually curious, believer, and evangelist.  To CNBC’s credit, the entire organization isn’t filled with seemingly anti-crypto commentators. On CNBC Africa, there’s Ran NeuNer, an early crypto investor and venture capitalist, that runs “Crypto Trader”, an occasional one-hour segment that covers conferences, price action, and news events in this budding industry. And on the “Fast Money” and “Futures Now” segments, CNBC brings on well-known analysts, like Tom Lee and Brian Kelly, some of which have a good understanding of the space. With this new knowledge that Kernen and his peers know more than they previously let on, many in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are hoping that CNBC can begin to take more balanced approaches towards this space. Whether or not this happens remains to be seen, however.",

        "passage": "A group of large banks are investing $50 million USD into a financial settlements system built atop blockchain technology, the latest in a string of blockchain-centric headlines coming out of the mainstream banking industry this year. That revelation comes via Reuters, which was told by an anonymous source close to the situation that approximately 12 banks were collectively investing into Fnality, a startup taking the reins on the so-called utility settlement coin (USC) project first outlined by London tech play Clearmatics and Swiss banking power UBS Group AG four years ago. It’s not presently known which institutions are joining forces behind Fnality, though likely investors include the world-leading banks that have joined UBS’s blockchain settlements initiative in the past, namely Barclays, BNY Mellon, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MUFG, and Santander.  The USC system, which the anonymous source said might be released in 2020, would involve digitizing major fiat currencies and thereafter using these tokenized versions on a blockchain settlements rail. The idea would be to bring greater speed and transparency to interbank payments. The advancement comes as others in mainstream finance are still skeptical toward blockchain. A few weeks ago, Cathy Bessant, the tech and operations chief at Bank of America, said she was still “bearish” on the tech: With that said, if projects like the USC effort really do launch in the coming months, then Bessant and her peers at Bank of America really will have something to trial. Another major wrinkle in the blockchain payments arena came earlier this year, when the leadership at banking giant JP Morgan confirmed it was working to activate settlement functionalities on its blockchain payments rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN). The IIN, which is built atop JP Morgan’s in-house private fork of Ethereum, Quorum, already boasts more than 200 participating banks and institutions to date. So why the pivot to settlements now? Last month, Morgan’s head of global clearing John Hunter said the shift would address optimizing bank processing flows, which have hitherto proven slow, manual, paper-intensive, and prone to compliance errors. Via the IIN, the bank is hoping to offer real-time validation that transactions are, in fact, accurate. Furthermore, the IIN will reportedly work in tanden with JPM Coin, the stablecoin-like token currently being built on Quorum. With Quorum just having been launched as the first supported blockchain on Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service, JP Morgan is angling for further major institutions to build out their own blockchain solutions. In related news, software consortium R3 announced earlier this month that a group of major banks had finished up trialing Voltron, a financial app that uses R3’s Corda distributed ledger as its foundation. Specifically, Voltron was aimed at optimizing the process around enterprise Letter of Credit transactions. 50 institutional participants from over 25 countries joined in on the project, with banking heavyweights like Alfa Bank, ING, and Societe Generale having tested the app during the pilot period. In their follow-up announcement, R3 said the trial had proven to be a strong success: So with Fnality, IIN, and Voltron now in play, it’s clear that some of the world’s biggest banks think blockchain tech has serious potential.",

Available to citizens and residents of the United States, as well as to citizens of China that have access to an American bank account, Robinhood was revolutionary because it allowed for users to buy and sell stocks for absolutely no commissions in either direction. Not only is the app commission-free, but it also allows for instant deposits, and a form of pseudo-instant settlement. Those who have access to the gold program can sell a stock and then immediately use the proceeds of that sale to buy a different stock without needing to wait several days for settlement. The only time users need to wait for settlement is when they want to withdraw their money.  The system does have anti-day trading measure enabled however, and those who are caught day trading can have their accounts severely restricted. Several months ago, Robinhood shocked the world of crypto by announcing that they would be soon allowing for users to buy and sell within the app, commission and fee-free. It should be noted that Robinhood is not going to be the crypto app of choice for everyone. Instead, it services are tailor-made for a very specific type of crypto investor. Today, the Robinhood app can only be used for buying and selling four cryptocurrencies within the app itself only. This means that users cannot use Robinhood as a cryptocurrency wallet. They cannot make deposits, nor can they withdraw cryptocurrencies from it. Basically speaking, any crypto bought within the app, stays in the app forever. So who is the Robinhood app for? Simply put, it’s for those that want to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in order to make a profit on the price difference. It is not for those that want to buy and hold cryptocurrencies in cold storage, or buy bitcoin and exchange it for altcoins, or invest it into an ICO. Another unfortunate side effect of Robinhood being US-based and complying with all relevant laws is that the app is only allowing cryptocurrency trading in a handful of US states. Specifically, only customers with a registered address in the following states can participate. They are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. So with only 17 states eligible for participation, more than half of the United States is being left out in the cold. And of course, so is the rest of the world. Not surprisingly, New York state is not on this list. This is because New York is infamous for its strict cryptocurrency laws, and they require any business that has dealings with citizens of New York to have a so-called “bit license”. Recently, Square’s Cash App was able to secure this license, but they are one of an even smaller handful of businesses to be lucky enough to get this license. And unfortunately for this author, who is not in one of the lucky 17 states, we are not able to try buying and selling cryptocurrencies on Robinhood firsthand. According to the official Robinhood cryptocurrency section of their website, the company is considering adding the ability to withdraw cryptocurrencies from Robinhood. The company says that while they don’t support withdrawals now, they “plan to do so in the near future.” In regards to making deposits of cryptocurrency, the company claims that they do not allow this because their “primary concern is to prevent money from illegal activity being used for transactions on Robinhood Crypto.” For now though, if you’re lucky enough to live in one of the 17 approved states, and your primary goal is just to buy low and sell high, Robinhood could be a dream come true. And with the addition of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin trading, that dream just got a little bit sweeter. For the rest of us, patience.",

        "passage": "Due to its nature as a pseudonymous, private, non-sovereign crypto asset, Bitcoin’s first major use case was as a medium of exchange on dark web markets. Silk Road, a well-known, now-defunct dark market where dealers could peddle everything from marijuana and fake passports to malware and asthma inhalers, spawned many early Bitcoin pioneers, acting as an on-ramp for individuals into the broader cryptocurrency industry.  Since authorities shut down the marketplace, however, many have assumed that BTC’s use in illicit activities has become a thing of the past. But, according to a recent report from blockchain analytics leader Chainalysis, this isn’t the case. In fact, the firm estimates that 2019 will be a record year for cryptocurrencies on the dark web. Reported by Bloomberg on Monday, Bitcoin’s use in illegal marketplaces only accessible via the crypto-friendly Tor Browser and other privacy-enabling browsers will see a record year in 2019. The report states that if dark web activity remains consistent, Bitcoin will make up at least $1 billion worth of transactions this year. Year-to-date, dark web markets have processed $515.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. For some comparison, 2017 saw Bitcoin account for $871.8 million in dark net transactions. Per Chainalysis’ research, the most popular secret market that uses Bitcoin is Hydra, which is somewhat of a spiritual successor to The Silk Road. And on these sites, narcotics and stolen credit card information are the most popular types of goods sold. If users aren’t inclined to use BTC, Chainalysis believes that Monero is another fan favorite. With Monero transactions begin predicated on obfuscation through Ring Signatures/CT technology, it is unclear how the firm managed to procure this data. It is important to note that Bitcoin’s use in illegal transactions is on the decline from an overarching point of view. As Hannah Curtis, a senior product manager at Chainalysis, tells Bloomberg, less than 1% of all transactional volume is related to dark web transactions, compared to 7% in 2012. This correlates with a chart posted by a Twitter analyst going by “CL”, which as seen below, shows that Bitcoin has become much more of an investment opportunity than a medium to transact value for contraband. In fact, as CL notes, search interest for “Bitcoin Silk Road” is so negligible that when charted against interest for “Bitcoin Investment”, the former doesn’t appear on the chart.  Bitcoin’s resurgence on dark web markets comes as cryptocurrencies have been finding growing use in retail applications. As reported by Blockonomi last week, gaming streaming site Twitch recently added back support for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash payments via BitPay after a three-month hiatus. In a similar string of news, at Consensus, a payments upstart known as Flexa unveiled Spedn. A play on “HODL”, an industry inside joke, Spedn is a solution that allows users to spend Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gemini Dollars, and Bitcoin Cash in certain partner chains. These partners include Nordstrom, Gamestop, Crate & Barrel, Bed Bath & Beyond, Lowe’s, and Whole Foods. These companies join Avnet, AT&T, and Microsoft as big-name firms that actively accept Bitcoin payments. While there aren’t any clear statistics on crypto’s use in retail transactions, more likely than not, Bitcoin is still mostly being used to transact value between exchanges, store wealth, hedge against financial risk and potential market collapses, and hide capital from governments, like China’s. But, the growth in the number of outlets for cryptocurrency use in our day-to-day is a positive sign nonetheless.",

        "passage": "A judge has ruled that the $21.6 million that has been the basis of a dispute between a Canadian bank and a cryptocurrency exchange will be handed over to the Ontario Superior Court, according to a court document. QuadrigaCX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, which had its access to $21.6 million kept in its business account denied by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in January 2018. The bank also froze the accounts of Custodian Inc., the payment processor employed by the exchange about the same.  Last December, CIBC reported that the Custodian Inc. accounts witnessed a surge in activity, with 388 individuals depositing $51.8 million between December 4th, 2017 and February 20t, 2018. Some of the money was eventually withdrawn, with roughly $21.6 million being left. Reports by The Globe and Mail revealed that CIBC froze the accounts, because the bank was unable to ascertain the real owners of the funds, before requesting for the court to take possession of the funds in the interim. The bank also asked for the court to establish the rightful owners of the funds between Custodian Inc. and a total of 388 individuals who made deposits into the exchange for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. However, QuadrigaCX continued to posit that a large chunk of the funds that were in contention belonged to the exchange, and that the bank was wrong to freeze any of its accounts. According to a court document, the trading platform urged that the court should not yield to the claims of the bank, stating that they were nothing but invidious and unverified conjectures that the transactions were questionable. QuadrigaCX believes the CIBC decided to freeze the funds of their customers deliberately. The exchange also accused the bank of looking for different- and illegal- means of further prolonging their ability to hold these funds while also trying to make an act which should not have happened initially to look rational. The company informed its customers via email that various Canadian banks had colluded to make its operations difficult by restricting its efforts to access the funds that were available in its savings accounts. It claimed the gang up was to prevent the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by various players in the Canadian economy. In a court ruling that was issued on the 9th of November, Judge Glenn Hainey of the Ontario Superior Court corroborated the position of the CIBC that the owners of the funds are unclear. The judge ordered that the money should be transferred from the bank to the Accountant of the Superior Court in order or the court to be able to trace who owns the money. However, the judge also declined to state whether the actions of the bank in freezing the accounts was improper. Judge Hainey stated in the court document: The bank’s decision to freeze the exchange’s funds hasn’t affected the exchange much, as the decision affected less than 1% of the exchange’s customers. Gerald Cotten, Chief Executive Officer at QuadrigaCX, said in an email correspondence with a local news outlet, that the pace with which the matter is moving “pleased” him, and that he is optimistic that the matter will be resolved before the turn of the year. Cotten also added: This dispute comes as the latest in a wave of investigations of “unscrupulous cryptocurrency investments” by regulators across the United States and Canada this year. As part of “Operation Cryptosweep,” which was commenced by the North American Securities Administration Association (NASA), well over 70 investigations were opened back in May, and more have been coming since then.

        "passage": "Cryptocurrencies aren’t without their flaws. Bitcoin, for instance, once suffered a devastating bug that temporarily shut down its blockchain. Stellar Lumens (XLM) recently joined the list of blockchain projects that were rocked by a bug, with a leading industry data provider revealing that millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency were quietly injected into the Stellar ecosystem early in 2017.  In its ongoing quest to offer the crypto community high-quality data, the New York-based Messari has revealed that per its research, 2.25 billion XLM was generated out of thin air during April 2017. The funny thing is, barely anyone knew about this debacle prior to Messari’s recent report. According to the research, the cryptocurrency was generated by an unknown attacker who utilized the “MereOPFrame::doApply” function in Stellar’s protocol, which was once bugged. While the public details about how the bug was harnessed are scant, the economic effect of the sudden attack is known. Messari writes that the tokens created were worth $10 million at the time, and represented upwards of 25% of all circulating XLM at the time. And interestingly, Stellar’s developers were purportedly unable to catch the attacker’s wallets in time, as the data provider explains that the 2.25 billion XLM injection was likely distributed to exchange wallets and subsequently sold during the first half of 2017. Per a comment from the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), action has since been taken to mitigate further debacles. The SDF burnt Lumens from its development war chest to “true up” the supply, specifically in a bid to ensure that XLM holders wouldn’t see a dilution of their holdings. The organization’s representatives added that “Stellar has since become significant financial software,” forcing the SDF’s hand to improve its transparency protocols, which will go live by the end of 2019. Stellar may have recently come under fire due to this news, but this is far from the first inflation bug in the cryptocurrency industry’s short history. During the mid-2018 creation of Bitcoin Private, which forked from both the Bitcoin and ZClassic chains, there were 102 suspicious blocks that contained 400 expected outputs apiece. These outputs, according to Coinmetrics, collectively contained 2,040,000 BTCP that was printed out of thin air, and subsequently routed to shielded addresses. While it is unclear who executed this clever attack, the executor was estimated to have made away with at least $1 million to $3 million. Even Bitcoin (yes, the Bitcoin) once saw more supply than it bargained for. During block 74638, mined on August 15th, 2010, 184 billion BTC was created, which totally decimated Bitcoin’s long-standing 21 million supply limit. Somehow, a user managed to create a transaction with a negative value, creating an integer overflow that spawned the billions of BTC. In this case, Gavin Andresen and the fabled Satoshi Nakamoto got to work near-immediately, purging the block from existence. While none of the 184 billion BTC ever made it to an exchange, third-party, or a user not complicit in the attack, the fact remains that cryptocurrencies, even the leading one, are far from infallible. In spite of all this, the SDF seems entirely unfazed by its inflation-ridden past. And maybe, that’s for good reason. Since April 2017, the project has skyrocketed to crypto fame, becoming one of the highest valued cryptocurrencies in existence. Whether this is due to its countless partnerships with IBM, its viability as a smart contracting platform, or other developments, Blockonomi isn’t too sure. But the SDF is looking to continue the Stellar Blockchain’s success with a recent announcement. On Tuesday, SDF revealed that it had partnered with Coinbase, specifically the startup’s Earn service, to give away $50 worth of XLM to hundreds of thousands of users that are willing to learn about the protocol.",

        "passage": "This week, investigators with the top Dutch anti-fraud watchdog, the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), arrested a man they argue defrauded investors out of millions of euros in what the suspect pitched as a bitcoin mining enterprise. The 33-year-old man, Berry van Mourik, had reportedly set up two companies to receive payments for purchasing or renting bitcoin miners at his mining farm. However, the circumstances around his arrest now suggest that mine may never existed, or if it did, it wasn’t around for long.  In 2017, the alleged conman began soliciting investments by promising monthly returns of approximately 0.3 bitcoin. After raking in dozens of investors with that deal, most never saw any returns ever dispensed, and victims of the ploy then notified authorities. FIOD estimates the man was able to accrue as much as €25 million in investments for the fraudulent scheme. As such, Dutch law enforcement raided the man’s home in 2018 and found a variety of luxury goods, which the police have since asserted was where the majority of the illegally diverted funds went to. Investors are unlikely to be made whole from the episode accordingly. Along with being hit by fraud charges, Mourik has also been accused of committing money laundering and forgery in the furtherance of his scheme. Another story that’s made headlines in the cryptoverse this week comes from Australia, where a government worker is facing more than 10 years in prison for illegally using an undisclosed agency’s equipment to mine cryptocurrency. The 33-year-old man, an IT contractor at the agency in question, reportedly mined more than $6,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency on the Australian Government gear. It’s unknown which asset or assets were mined, though either CPU or GPU mining was involved in the absence of ASIC rigs. In announcing the man’s court appearance, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed it had raided his residence back in the springtime and had confiscated a “personal laptop, personal phone, employee ID cards and data files” in connection to the case. Chris Goldsmid, a commander in the AFB’s cybercrimes unit, said the incident represented a transgression against the public’s trust the likes of which his team is actively looking to crack down on: Speaking of policing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on May 21st it had been awarded a restraining order and asset freeze against Argyle Coin, which the Commission said was engaging in an “ongoing $30 million Ponzi scheme targeting more than 300 investors in the U.S. and Canada.” Per the SEC, the now under-fire project’s backers have falsely claimed their venture was “risk-free because it was backed by fancy colored diamonds … promising to use investor funds to develop [a] cryptocurrency business.” Instead, the securities watchdog argues Argyle Coin’s leadership used millions of dollars worth of investments to pay off other project investors. “The SEC’s diligent investigative work uncovered the Ponzi schemes and our goal is to bring justice to the harmed investors,” said the Commission’s Miami Office Director Eric Bustillo. The cryptocurrency ecosystem may currently be a Wild West of sorts, then, but its clear that big national regulators like the SEC and FIOD aren’t going to let egregious cryptocurrency-centric violations fly under their watch. Of course, there will always be those who think the risks of cons are worth the rewards. But for criminals in the cryptoeconomy, their toilings come as more authorities are eyeing the space than ever before.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin miners are now recovering from the effects of the bearish wave that engulfed the market last year until the beginning of 2019. Cryptocurrency mining firm Riot Blockchain published its financial report, which showed a net loss of $58 million for the 2018 fiscal year. The former veterinary and life science firm swooped into the mining business, adding blockchain to its name following the industry hype. The company attributes the losses to the depreciation of assets, non-cash aggregate impairments, compensation, and amortization expenses that the company racked up in the year. The report stated that all of these costs amounted to a $45.2 million deficit in its bottom line.   On the flip side, the company posted $7.7 million in earnings accrued from mining a total of 1,081 Bitcoin (BTC) tokens, including converted Bitcoin Cash (BCH) tokens, and 3,023 Litecoin (LTC) tokens. The company says there is no long-term debt on its account, and that it actually recorded a positive gross margin of 33 percent before costs relating to impairment, amortization, and depreciation were recorded.  In its report, the Nasdaq-listed crypto mining company also gave some insight into its ongoing probe by the United States Securities and Exchange omission (SEC), claiming that it is still collaborating with the agency. Early last year, Riot revealed via its 2017 annual report that it had been issued with a subpoena from the SEC, which compelled it to provide the regulatory agency with specific information. At the time, the former biotech company claimed that the SEC reviewed the company’s filings and had requested that it provides certain information concerning its assets’ classification as, and amount of, possible Investment Company assets.” The document also added that the company intended to cooperate fully with the agency. The investigation of Riot was in line with the SEC’s objective of probing companies that had pivoted towards blockchain technology in the wake of the crypto boom of 2017. At that time, cryptocurrencies were experiencing a spike in their value, and companies involved in blockchain technology and digital assets were receiving massive interest from investors.  Riot, which was formerly named “Bioptix,” made the pivot to blockchain and crypto mining services in 2017, changing its name to accommodate the word “blockchain” and acquiring a minority stake in Canada-based crypto exchange platform Coinsquare in 2017. A separate SEC filing also revealed that the company had acquired 92.5 percent of Logical Brokerage Corp., a futures brokerage firm based in Miami, saying that it was considering the launch of “digital currency exchange and a futures brokerage operation within the United States.” In a quarterly report shared on August 14, 2018, Riot revealed that it got a letter from the SEC on July 30, stating that the agency had begun looking into its registration activities, in accordance with Section 8 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Section states that if the SEC believes that any entity’s registration statement had “any untrue statement” or omitted any “material facts,” it may “issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.” Riot’s stock dropped 12 percent some few hours after announcing the probe by the agency. In its filing, Riot said, “The Company is engaged in conversations with the staff of the Division of Enforcement, Division of Investment Management and Division of Corporation Finance about their concerns and intends to cooperate fully with the examination.”",

        "passage": "Cryptocurrency exchange behemoth, Coinbase has decommissioned its political action committee (PAC). This move comes after nine months after the San Francisco-based exchange service created the PAC which incidentally did not raise any funds. Meanwhile, there continues to be a growing intersection of cryptocurrency and politics not just in the United States but in other countries as well. With virtual currencies enjoying a period of significant gains, Bitcoin and the likes have become even more popular topics of conversation in the political sphere.  According to the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC), Coinbase submitted a termination report for its PAC on Wednesday (April 3, 2019). Details released by the FEC show that the Coinbase PAC registered zero fundraising on spending activities during its tenure. The FEC has yet to approve the request to terminate the PAC. Thus, Coinbase will have to continue providing filing disclosures though it seems unlikely that any money will flow through the PAC. The news of the termination comes less than a year after the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange giant first created the PAC. Called the Coinbase Inc., PAC, it became public knowledge via an FEC filing back in July 2018. At the time, commentators espoused the idea of the PAC being an attempt by the Coinbase hierarchy to increase their lobbying efforts in Washington. With the mid-term elections approaching several stakeholders in the U.S. cryptocurrency scene were trying to back politicians with a friendly disposition to virtual currencies. Earlier in 2018, Andreessen Horowitz and other VC juggernauts launched a plan to lobby the U.S. Congress for more crypto-friendly regulations. Many stakeholders expressed concerns over the approach being taken by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the Coinbase PAC might not have yielded any donations or funded any candidates, there is an observable uptrend in the relationship between cryptocurrency companies and those on Capitol Hill. Most of the lobbying efforts seemed geared towards the emergence of regulations that will promote the growth of the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. These efforts might be yielding fruit in the form of the Token Taxonomy Act, as well as a patchwork of cryptocurrency and blockchain-friendly legislations being passed in different State Senates. Despite the progress made thus far, there are still some contentions over proposals like the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for virtual currencies. Critics say the regulatory framework offers no property rights for virtual currency holders and does not ensure super-negotiability for cryptocurrency transactions. Andrew Yang, a U.S. presidential hopeful of the Democratic Party has even put clear-cut cryptocurrency regulations as one of his campaign promises. So far, the U.S. continues to be behind other countries in the area of establishing a firm regulatory environment for virtual currencies. Outside of the United States, there are developing political undertones to cryptocurrency adoption for countries like Russia, Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, to mention a few. Rumors have recently emerged saying Russia used Bitcoin to support newly elected Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela appear to be embracing cryptocurrency as a means of circumventing U.S. economic sanctions. Following the collapse of the country’s economy, citizens of Venezuela have taken to Bitcoin mining as a way of ensuring their continued survival. Several cybersecurity experts allege that North Korea is behind the hacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. Reports indicate that Pyongyang is using the proceeds of these hacks to continue its nuclear weapons program.",

        "passage": "As the price of Bitcoin has rebounded, so has investor interest in the cryptocurrency asset class. Recent surveys have confirmed that while not many common Joes and Jills own cryptocurrencies today, there continues to be rising demand, boding rather well for the industry’s long-term prospects.  To many of crypto’s cynics, Bitcoin is an unwanted asset, loved by no one and poised to enter a “death spiral”. According to a recent study conducted by Grayscale and Q8 Research, during which the two firms surveyed 1,100 Americans that are between 25 and 64, this is far from the case. The survey found that over 36% of those in the respondents’ demographic are interested in purchasing Bitcoin. Per Grayscale, the figure can be extrapolated to suggest that 21 million investors — the maximum number of BTC that will ever be in circulation — are interested in the cryptocurrency. With the U.S. only representing a small portion of the world’s population, this statistic could be seen as rather bullish. Grayscale and Q8 then elaborated on why there is demand for BTC. The two firms laid out three primary themes. Firstly, “Bitcoin-curious” investors found that knowing that they can start small in cryptocurrency — build up small portfolios by purchasing fractions of a coin — is drawing them in. Secondly, the group noted that they see Bitcoin as an attractive asymmetric bet, meaning a financial play with notable growth potential. And lastly, these investors confirmed the idea that Bitcoin’s scarcity, which will soon be accentuated during the next halving, is what draws many investors in. To follow up, the two firms then discovered why investors are hesitant to foray into Bitcoin. 75% of all investors surveyed claimed that they are wary of crime in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With scams, exchange hacks, and odd run-ins with regulators being a common sight in the industry — which has only recently been accentuated from comments from Donald Trump and other individuals — it is clear to see why most are afraid of crypto-crime. The survey found that despite cryptocurrencies being reported to be cool with millennials and those that are younger, the average Bitcoin-curious investor is a 42-year-old male or female that is a parent and makes less than $100,000 this year. What’s interesting is that Grayscale and Q8 also found that those wanting to purchase the cryptocurrency claimed to be more experienced than average investors, implying that Bitcoin is starting to become seen to be a logical investment decision. Indeed, since bottoming in mid-December, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have outperformed any traditional asset class, leaving most stocks, even hot blue-chip ones, in the dust. Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency-friendly markets research firm, found last year that allocating 3% of one’s capital to BTC actually gives the average investor’s portfolio a higher Sharpe Ratio. Also, the cryptocurrency is increasingly being seen as a safe-haven play. So in a world where there are boiling geopolitical tensions, strains on the macroeconomy, and a growing number of authoritarian states, Bitcoin may just make sense. The uptick in potential demand for Bitcoin has come amid a push to make accessing the cryptocurrency market easier. Lolli, a Bitcoin earning service startup, is at the tip of this spear. Recently, the company, which gives consumers a chance to earn BTC for shopping online by simply installing a plugin, recently partnered with Albertsons’ subsidiary, Safeway. The grocery chain, which is popular in the United States and Canada, and Lolli will be offering up to a 3.5% BTC rebate for those that shop for Safeway goods online.",

        "passage": "Blockchain reorgs are generally cast as assaults, namely in the manner of a 51 percent attack. Yet after the cryptoeconomy’s most popular exchange Binance was hacked out of a whopping 7,000 bitcoin this week, a reorg of the Bitcoin blockchain was floated as a way to potentially remedy the attack. The suggestion quickly generated controversy.  The current round of reorg debates started after Jeremy Rubin, a cryptocurrency specialist and past contributor to Bitcoin Core, suggested in the early aftermath of the hack that Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao could explore reaching out to bitcoin miners to “coordinate a reorg to undo the theft,” i.e. to reorg the stolen BTC out of the attackers’ control.  Shortly after Rubin’s tweets, the suggestion was passed along to Zhao, who then mentioned the possibility of a “rollback” on a livestream update with the Binance community. However, it didn’t take long for Zhao to leave the notion behind upon reaching out to knowledgeable stakeholders in the ecosystem. The Binance CEO cited the possibility of damaging the “credibility” of bitcoin as well as the impracticality of corralling the necessary support as reasons for not pushing for a reorg.  Yet even after Zhao seemed to put the matter to rest, debates about reorgs started picking up steam in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. One day after the hack, the reorg topic reached enough of a fever pitch that Zhao issued another comment on the episode, arguing that Rubin’s suggestion was briefly considered — nothing more — in the wake of an emergency.  Others were surprised the possibility of a reorg was publicly considered at all. Michael Novogratz, co-founder of the crypto bank Galaxy Digital, called such talk “close to heresy.” Responding to Novogratz’s comment, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin argued that a remedial rollback of everyone’s transactions would be “possibly fatal” for a project.  For his part, Andreas Antonopoulos, author and co-author of Mastering Bitcoin and Mastering Ethereum respectively, likened a remedial reorg as akin to a “bail-out for a bank,” adding that “there won’t be a bailout here.”  Others, like Larry Cermak of The Block, suggested a reorg was pointless because Binance would be able to generate revenue to make up for the lost funds within a matter of weeks. Moreover, the exchange already sets aside 10 percent of its trading fees for a fund to cover black swan events like hacks.  As reorg chatter increased, many analysts and pundits in the space said Binance should not pursue the controversial strategy. However, others highlighted that the strategy was totally permissible on a technical level and was thus one that could always be pursued, for better or for worse and whether anyone liked it or not.  On a related note, Bitcoin Udi Wertheimer highlighted in an associated thread that “There’s no absolute finality in bitcoin,” only practical finality. That is to say, there may be a block depth in the Bitcoin ledger that is too deep for any party to feasibly reach during a reorg, but it’s not a set number that can be readily known.  With that said, the aforementioned Jeremy Rubin later added he still thought a reorg “within 6 blocks” could be a “standard way of dealing with a hack” like the kind Binance was hit with this week.  Whether you think a remedial reorg is a good idea or bad idea, it’s clear such a move would be very expensive. In the early wake of the Binance hack, Bitcoin developer and entrepreneur Jimmy Song calculated that it would’ve already taken hundreds of BTC by that point to effectively pay for a reorg of the Bitcoin network.

        "passage": "The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York has indicted the head of a bitcoin escrow company for defrauding investors of $7 million. According to the press release published by the division of the Department of Justice, head of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC, Jon Barry Thompson, was charged with two counts each of commodity and wire fraud on Thursday. Thompson was accused of airbrushing investment risks and false representations of digital assets custody and control, per the release.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated that Thompson lured investors by painting cryptocurrency as a zero-to-low risk investment. Thompson allegedly duped two unnamed companies of $3 million and $4 million in June and July 2018. He promised to invest the funds in Bitcoin and sent false profit records to the victim companies. Neither of the companies received any bitcoin, and Thompson did not return the invested funds. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies,” said Geoffrey. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney added that Thompson capitalized on the ignorance of both companies on cryptocurrency.  “Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest in Bitcoin. Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn’t understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency.” The two commodities fraud charges that were slammed against Thompson each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and each count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Thus, Thompson now faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Cases of crypto-crime like Thompson’s fraud has been rampant of late. With the nascent growth of the cryptocurrency sector, more individuals are willing to go to desperate lengths to get their hands on some coins. In March, 46-year-old New Yorker, Patrick McDonnell was indicted for swindling about 10 victims of at least $194,000 in cryptocurrency. His method was similar to Thompson’s– under the flag of a website called CabbageTech, McDonnell promised investors that he would provide trading advice and purchase and trade cryptocurrency on their behalf. He claimed to help his customers buy bitcoin when he was actually using the pooled funds for personal purposes. On July 25, 46-year old William Green of Wall Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey was also charged by a grand jury for operating an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange. Using a website dubbed Destination Bitcoin, Green converted fiat to cryptocurrency for his customers for a small fee. Although his crime is different from Thompson’s, his transmitting activities were not registered according to the prescribed rules guiding cryptocurrency exchanges. Crypto scams are increasingly littering the face of the crypto sector globally, and are a major drawback for the growth of the sphere. The worrying rate is only making more regulators edgy towards digital assets, and this is causing restrictive crackdowns that are only making it harder for adoption and legalization of the coin. In a recent finding on Bitcoin.com, $1.36 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen by fraudsters during the first two months of 2018. Of this amount, cryptocurrency fraud accounted for 30 percent. It was followed by hacking attempts (22 percent), theft and exit scams (17 percent each), and phishing (13 percent).",

        "passage": "Bitcoin hasn’t had the best of weeks. Since Sunday, the cryptocurrency has fallen in price by more than 20%. Due to the sudden nature of this move, investors sought to figure out potential catalysts. As reported by Blockonomi, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of BitBull Capital, looked to the lackluster launch of Bakkt coupled with a rapid drop in Bitcoin’s hash rate, which saw the metric fall from just shy of 100 exahashes per second to 67 in a spectacular fashion.  According to one analyst, however, the correlation drawn between the hash rate and Bitcoin’s day-to-day value is categorically wrong. What’s more, he suggests that the Bitcoin “hashcrash”, as some have dubbed the seeming collapse in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, may have never taken place. When nearly half of Bitcoin’s hash rate — a metric used to describe the level of computational power backing the network and processing BTC transactions — seemingly disappeared overnight, investors were  quick to express their concerns on online forums. Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer noted that this trend looks “very unhealthy”, before going on to bash the seeming shortcomings of Bitcoin’s Proof of Work system and its relation to exchange security.  Others simply pointed to the fact that if the metric was real, it meant that a massive amount of cryptocurrency mining infrastructure — farms worth dozens of millions of dollars — were suddenly shut down, implying a decrease in interest in BTC. Trade publications quickly picked up on this story, spreading a sense of uncertainty throughout the industry. However, Sasha Fleyshman, a trader at crypto investment firm Arca, recently came out to remark that this flash crash in Bitcoin’s hash rate is likely a misnomer. He broke down his findings and analysis of the odd debacle in an extensive Twitter thread, which he summed up as a way to debunk the “FUD fuel” that was the hashcrash.  Firstly, he noted that there is unlikely one mining farm or entity that has access to 40% of the network, let alone enough access to shutdown thousands of mining machines for an entire day. And even if one entity had such leverage, what would be the point? To lose tens of thousands of dollars worth of potential profits, to stave off a large mining difficulty adjustment, or to slow down block times for a few days? No, likely not. Fleyshman then explained that the way in which hash rate is calculated by many metric providers is inherently susceptible to anomalies, which is a byproduct of Bitcoin not inherently calculating the extent of the computational power securing its network. The Arca trader made reference to a Twitter thread by the founder of blockchain startup Summa, which outlined that an irregular 18-minute block is likely the anomaly behind the -35% reading for Bitcoin’s hash rate on some metrics providers. He suggested that due to the way in which Bitcoin’s hash rate is estimated, a single 18-minute block may have had an outsized effect on the calculations, leading to the harrowing reading. While the steep dropoff in Bitcoin mining activity shocked investors, all is now well. The hash rate of the leading blockchain network is now edging closer to 100 exahashes per second once again, and is, according to Hans Hauge of Ikigai, a key sign that Bitcoin is fundamentally stronger than ever and not in a bear market.

While the company confirmed the downsizing but declined to divulge any information on the headcount, there are indications that the toll affected not less than 15 employees.   An insider at Coinbase who preferred to remain anonymous was quoted by Yahoo stating:  With a staff strength of 550 employees, showing just 15 persons the exit door may look insignificant. Nevertheless, downsizing of any proportion at Coinbase would surely attract attention especially at a time when observers presume the company is gearing to go public. Sequel to the sum of $500 million raised from a group of private investors this month, the company’s valuation rose to $8 billion.  The company also replaced former board member David Marcus from Facebook with Chris Dodds, a member on the board at Charles Schwab. According to the report, Coinbase made it known through a statement that the co-location of certain teams tends to yield greater efficiency and motivation. The statement further reads: The digital assets platform also hired former Salesforce and Twitter executive, Tina Bhatnagar, to oversee customer service. Based on the statements released by Coinbase, it’s obvious a good number of those who were dispensed off their services were remote employees.  They were part of the customer service team hired during the company’s initial growth phase in 2013. At the time, the exchange had stated that it was “building a remote customer support team to accommodate our growing user base.” That notwithstanding, some remote employees were given the option of relocating to a Coinbase office. The report also noted that Coinbase acknowledged the improvement in its customers’ services. Coinbase included in the statement saying: The downsizing of its staffs also reflects on current market conditions. There was a surge in the cryptocurrency market at the end of 2017 which elicited companies in embarking on massive recruitment. During the rush, Coinbase had to deal with the enormous task of signing up 50,000 new customers.  This further helped it in building out that decentralized customer support team. The tide has, however, turned against it, with the prices of cryptocurrencies dipping since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin (BTC) has lost a significant value bringing it to 62% this year; Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has felt the same toll by 82%, and Ether (ETH) has seen over a 79% decline from its January price. To make matters worse for Coinbase, trading volumes are generally down Coinbase currently boasts of 25 million users with a vast network of offices in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Portland, Oregon, Tokyo, Dublin, and London. In January, Coinbase buoyed its technical strength with the recruitment of a former Salesforce and Twitter executive Tina Bhatnagar. ",

Moths after its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the company, which has only been operating or a little over a year, has finally closed its doors. The statement from the company reads: Giga Watt went on to note that those who have completed their know-your-customer verification can withdraw the remaining crypyocurrencies left in their wallets, although this window closes in March.  In conclusion, the mining firm assured clients that any change to its situation will be communicated to customers, in due time. The closure has been shocking for its clients. While customers knew about the company’s debt situation, no one thought a complete shutdown was imminent. Giga Watt was established in September 2017 via an initial coin offering (ICO). Since it launched, the mining company has prided itself on its ability to provide inexpensive alternatives for crypto miners, regardless of their scale. The company claimed that it was able to generate affordable electricity, which was offered to clients for their daily mining operations. However, the company had a business model that was slightly different from that of other manufacturers of crypto hardware. With Giga Watt, customers maintained ownership of the mining hardware, while the company earned maintenance fees from the client’s mining rewards. Also, clients were informed via Giga Watt’s customer support page on Telegram that they could make payments to have their mining hardware shipped to their homes. The bitcoin mining company offered much more competitive rates on utilities such as electricity, and this turned out to be unsustainable, especially considering the crypto winter. Just two days before the company made its formal bankruptcy announcement; customers were reportedly having issues with their miners. Reports surfaced of miners suddenly shutting off, with no explanation from the company seemingly likely. Upon inquiries, customer care representatives of the company had assured clients that all was well. However, when the company declared for bankruptcy, related documents showed that the company’s issues stemmed majorly from non-payment. Giga Watt eventually filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2018, at a Washington court. According to the filing, it was revealed that the company owed 20 of its largest unsecured creditors a total of $7 million. Some of these creditors included Neppel Electric, which had a claim of almost $500,000, and a utilities provider in Douglas County, which was owed $310,000. Besides, the company’s total assets were an estimated $50,000, while its total liabilities ranged between $10 million and $15 million. The crypto winter has continued to impact crypto-based businesses. Earlier this week, Blockonomi reported that mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain would be shutting down operations in its Rockdale, Texas plant. The company, which recently went through a major reshuffle that ended with the replacement of its two co-CEOs, has revealed its intention to shut down its $500 million mining plant, which was opened in August 2018. Bitmain has been shutting down its international offices of recent. The crypto hardware manufacturer had previously packed up Bitmaintech Israel, the blockchain development center that developed the Connect BTC mining pool. It also confirmed reports it would be closing down its Amsterdam office, as a spokesperson for the firm, said the closure was necessitated by the need to remodel the company’s business framework.",

        "passage": "Binance has officially announced that as from next week, it will no longer offer withdrawals or trading options for Bitcoin SV (BSV), per a post on its official blog. In the post, the exchange pointed out that it will delist and stop offering trading on all available trading pairs of BSV, a currency which was only created last year November, after Bitcoin Cash had forked.  In the announcement, Binance claims it routinely reviews tokens listed its platform to ensure that “every asset continues to meet the high level of standard that we expect.” The company asserts that a delisting action, such as this, will only be made necessary after an asset has gone through a thorough review, as they believe delisting is the only way to protect their users. The exchange also pointed out that before it goes on a delisting action, it considers factors such as the quality and level of the asset’s development, responsiveness to its requests o due diligence, and “any evidence of fraudulent or unethical conduct.” The exchange concluded by saying that it will continue to support withdrawals of BSV until 10:000 am UTC on July 22.  From then on, the currency would no longer be available for any financial transaction on its platform. The delisting action is coming just a few days after Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Chief Executive Officer of Binance, made a threat to carry out this exact action. In a tweet from his account, CZ had warned that Binance would delist BSV if Craig Wright, the developer of the currency, refused to desist from his aggressive behavior on Twitter. Shortly after the Binance delisting tweet, other exchanges started following suit. The first was Kraken which ran a poll asking their followers if they should also delist BSV, the result so far is a resounding 72% in favor.  Next up, was Erik Voorhees, founder of Shapeshift who also said they will delist within 48hours.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin SV is down 21% in the last 24 hours, if more exchanges join in the delisting of the coin, it could spell trouble for BSV from which it will have a very hard time recovering. Craig Wright has- on multiple occasions- stated that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator, and founder of Bitcoin (BTC). Wright has been in the news recently, as he offered a $5,000 reward in BSV to anyone who had information on the identity of Hodlnaut, a Twitter user who mainly gained popularity for starting the Lightning Torch Network, Lightning Network-based crypto humanitarian platform. Hodlnaut, whose Twitter account has now been deleted, found himself (or herself, as the case may very well be) as the subject of the entrepreneur’s ire after directly accusing him of falsely claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto and calling him a fraud. In addition to Hodlnaut, Wright also issued legal notices to a few of his detractors, including Peter McCormack, the host of popular podcast channel “What Bitcoin Did,” who has publicly claimed that Wright is not Nakamoto.  In response to Wright’s bounty, numerous members of the crypto community began a campaign to protect the entity of Hodlnaut, including changing their Twitter profile names and display pictures to that of the anonymous user. Since Hodlnaut’s account wasn’t verified, it would be impossible for anyone actually to find him (or her). Still, the Twitter cryptoverse didn’t stop there. They began the #WeAreAllHodlnaut campaign in a bid to show solidarity with the embattled user. In addition to that, they showed extensive support to CZ and called on other popular crypto exchanges to delist BSV as well, with the #DelistBSV hashtag. It would seem that the requests are beginning to gain traction. On its Twitter account, popular exchange Kraken conducted an online poll on whether or not it should delist BSV as well. As of this writing, the poll has gotten 5,264 votes, of which 77 percent voted in the positive.",

According to its latest announcement, Coinbase users can now back up their Wallet’s private keys to their cloud storage accounts, including Google Drive or iCloud. The new initiative will provide a safeguard for users, where they end up losing their funds because they misplaced their private keys.  The post from the exchange reads:  Up until now, Coinbase users have had to store their private keys on their mobile device, which provided the only way to access their cryptocurrencies. This created a problem as losing Coinbase ‘user-controlled wallets’ or failing to back up the recovery phrase meant losing the funds forever. With the new cloud backup feature, the exchange will make the encrypted version of the private keys available to all users allowing them to keep their funds safe irrespective of what happens to their device. Per the blog post, the private keys will be encrypted with “AES-256-GCM encryption” and stored on the cloud account, but it can only be accessed with the Coinbase Wallet mobile app, while the private keys can only be decrypted using the user’s chosen password. In cases, where the user loses access to their device, they can quickly recover their funds by using a combination of a password, which they would decide, and their iCloud or Google Drive accounts. The Cloud feature is an addition to the current security features on Coinbase Wallet. The exchange’s users will still have the option to view and store their 12-word recovery phrase and back it up manually. The announcement from Coinbase has generated a backlash from the crypto community who have always warned against the risks associated with storing sensitive data on the cloud, which has been riddled with poor data management and a plethora of SIM Swapping hacks, which has been on the increase of late.  CEO of U.S. exchange Kraken Jesse Powell was quick to criticize Coinbase’s decision to provide a cloud storing feature for user’s private keys, saying it would cause more problems than solve the existing ones. He stated on Twitter: “I am not a fan of training users on bad security. Cloud storage, while convenient, is constantly compromised, especially with all the SIM porting. 99% chance the people who would unwittingly use this do not have passwords strong enough to withstand professional cracking. #SFYL”  Earlier this month, a 20-year old SIM-Swap crypto thief was indicted from stealing cryptocurrencies from over 50 victims in the U.S. According to the office of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, Dawson Bakies, a resident of Ohio, stole the identities and the crypto funds of his victims using a SIM-Swapping attack by fraudulently linking his victim’s cell phone numbers to multiple iPhones controlled by him.",

        "passage": "Mainstream media lambasts the cryptocurrency industry for housing the world’s unsavory. Incumbent President Donald Trump argued in his now infamous thread on Bitcoin and Libra that digital assets can “facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity”. Some others in the who’s who of global finance and politics have expressed a similar sentiment, lambasting cryptocurrencies for their ability to perpetuate the world’s issues.  They aren’t technically wrong. As reported by Blockonomi previously, cryptocurrency crime is a $4 billion industry in 2019, with bad actors scamming and hacking innocents for millions each and every day. A report from Chainalysis also suggested that digital assets were the payment medium for $1 worth of billion dark web purchases in the first half of 2019. But, what the aforementioned pundits do wrong is cast a single blanket over all of the cryptocurrency industry, claiming that all of those involved — us, really — aren’t above board. This couldn’t be further from the truth. That’s what Fidelity Charitable, the philanthropic arm of Wall Street’s Fidelity Investments, suggests anyway. As spotted by CoinDesk, Fidelity Charitable recently surmounted a key milestone, revealing in an annual report that it has received more than $100 million worth of crypto-asset donations since 2015. In 2018, $30 million of the branch’s $5 billion in contributions were made through cryptocurrencies. While this is a small percentage, it goes to show that charity is a part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, just like all other industries. Interestingly, Fidelity Charitable bagged $69 million in crypto donations over 2017, making digital assets the fastest-growing asset type accepted by Fidelity. The report claimed that “non-publicly traded assets”, which includes everything from private stock and real estate to cryptocurrencies, ” represent a significant portion of wealth in the United States but have traditionally been a largely untapped source of philanthropic funding.” Despite this, cryptocurrency investors have been quite charitable, despite the small size and nascency of the industry. Crypto donations aren’t a new trend. Last year, Brian Armstrong of Coinbase revealed that he had signed the Giving Pledge, a formal declaration of charity targeted at billionaires created by Warren Buffet and Bill Gates. Armstrong joins BitMEX’s Ben Delo, Kathleen Breitman of Tezos, Elon Musk, Michael Bloomberg, Gates and Buffet themselves, among some of the world’s most well-known entrepreneurs, investors, and company founders. Armstrong is also behind GiveCrypto, a charity aimed at distributing cryptocurrencies “to people in need.” GiveCrypto, a net benefit for both the impoverished and the crypto industry, has already garnered boatloads of traction, with the CEOs of Ripple, Electric Coin Company, Bitcoin.com, BitMEX, and countless other preeminent crypto startups donating collective millions to the initiative. Charity has also spread to a crypto corporate level. Binance late last year announced that it would be donating all listing fees that cryptocurrency projects pay to be listed on the renowned exchange. And even the common Joes and Jills in the cryptocurrency industry, like you or I, have proven to be quite charitable. When the Notre Dame in Paris was damaged in a devastating fire, the cryptocurrency community banded together to donate tens of thousands. So why donate cryptocurrencies? Why not donate fiat monies, which can be inflated away at the whim of central banks? Well, according to an excerpt from the report: It also may make sense from a pure fundamental standpoint. Unlike the fiat system, cryptocurrencies can be transacted near-instantly, across the world, and at an extremely low cost compared to the multi-day, often high-fee wire system that most charities likely enlist at current.",

On July 12th, Kyber’s builders announced the arrival of non-custodial limit orders on KyberSwap. The capability allows traders to set up trades to buy or sell a given cryptocurrency when a specific price is hit, all without needing to deposit crypto first — funds are automatically moved when a trade executes.  Through the liquidity-focused DEX’s mobile app or website, users can prepare these limit orders easily and quickly. An added advantage will be the ability to avoid the fees associated with deposit transactions. The move comes as a bid to make traders happy and to set KyberSwap apart from the centralized and decentralized competition, explained Kyber network co-founder and chief executive officer Loi Luu on the news: Execution fees for limit order trades will bottom out at 0.1 percent on the DEX. Additionally, traders will also enjoy fee discounts if the wallets they trade from contain Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), the native token of the Kyber ecosystem. As decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges march toward being able to do most everything their centralized counterparts can do, their popularity is only set to grow. Limit orders are a mainstay on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, so KyberSwap isn’t reinventing the wheel with their new feature. What the DEX is doing, though, is offering a service in trustless and non-custodial fashion, something that isn’t possible on today’s centralized platforms. As Kyber pointed out in their Friday announcement, centralized trading venues are also prone to hacks, high fees, and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, none of which apply to DEX platforms. So a play like KyberSwap wants to provide the best of both worlds: features that any trader would want with the security guarantees and practicality that comes with non-custodial trading. As CEO Luu put it: KyberSwap is Kyber Network’s in-house DEX. But the Kyber Network itself is a liquidity aggregator that provides on-chain liquidity for other decentralized exchanges, too. In that capacity, the network has now processed almost one million ether worth of transactions to date. In early July, Kyber’s leadership revealed their network had facilitated over 827,000 ETH in total transaction volume at the time. The team also noted that one million KNC had been burned by that point, as Kyber’s tokens are deflationary — a small sum of KNC is destroyed every time the Kyber Network makes a transaction. In declaring the milestone, CEO Luu said demand for the Kyber Network was growing, and the project’s ecosystem wasn’t going any where any time soon:",

This announcement comes as the platform says it no longer has access to its cold wallets which contain an unnamed but significant amount of customer funds.  In a statement published on the company’s website on Thursday (Jan. 31, 2019), the company says that it filed for creditor protection in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. According to the announcement, QuadrigaCX says the move is in accordance with the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). For QuadrigaCX, creditor protection will pave the way for it to examine its financial health in the wake of the recent crisis. As part of the application, the exchange platform wishes the Court to appoint Ernst and Young as a third-party overseer of its efforts to sort out financial issues currently plaguing the business. A portion of the statement reads: The loss of the platform’s access to its cold wallets could potentially mean trouble for QuadrigaCX as it may not be able to fulfill its obligations to its customers. The news of this loss of access comes at a time when the cryptocurrency exchange is mourning the passing of its founder, Gerald Cotten.  Back in November 2018, Blockonomi reported that QuadrigaCX lost ownership of more than $21 million in a legal tussle between the platform and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). At the time, the CIBC had frozen the platform’s accounts, challenging the ownership of the funds. The court eventually ruled in favor of QuadrigaCX with the platform getting a significant portion of frozen funds released. However, since that time, the Bitcoin exchange has been unable to secure a banking partnership for receiving customer deposits. Before this present crisis, QuadrigaCX was the largest Bitcoin exchange in Canada based on daily trading volume. Back in 2017, the platform was part of the consortium of companies that stood against the proposed Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork. With QuadrigaCX customers currently in limbo, the debate about the safety of cryptocurrencies stored in exchange platform takes center stage yet again. Usually, traders lose funds due to hacks or exit scams, but this time, the platform says it cannot access its cold storage (which is supposed to be safest storage option as far exchanges are concerned). Earlier in January, a debate broke out on Twitter about the safest way to store Bitcoin and other cryptos. Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell weighing in on the issue at the time, advised traders not to store cryptocurrencies on exchange platforms. According to Powell, users would be better served to utilize hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger.  During the debate, many commentators countered Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao (‘CZ’) who said self-storage options are more trouble than they were worth. For CZ, traders should utilize “reputable” platforms or decentralized exchanges (DEX). At the start of the month, foremost Bitcoin evangelist Trace Mayer held the first-ever Proof-of-Keys event during which traders were urged to withdraw all Bitcoin held with third-party exchanges. One of the main aims of the event was to demonstrate cryptocurrency ownership which has spawned the maxim “not your keys, not your Bitcoin.”",

        "passage": "2018’s Bitcoin bear market hasn’t been kind to industry startups. Save for a few exceptions in Binance and BitMEX, crypto companies got slammed across the board. South Korean exchange giant Bithumb, for instance, was reported to have lost $180 million over 2018, partially as a result of a brutal hack that likely lost the platform business in large quantities. Some companies collapsed entirely, as they failed to establish financial security as the crypto holdings lost 90%+ of their U.S. value. While others, like ShapeShift and Bitmain, laid off employees in the dozens. But, after over a year of brutal price action, the market has begun to turn, and the startups affected by the so-called “crypto winter” are finally starting to return to their feet. It seems, however, that ConsenSys, an Ethereum development consortium, needs a helping hand though.  According to a recent report from The Information, the New York-headquartered blockchain group, headed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, is currently searching for a large sum of venture capital funding. Citing “several people with knowledge of the plans,” the outlet explains that ConsenSys, which houses MetaMask, Infura, and countless other key pieces of Ethereum infrastructure, is actively seeking $200 million from “outside investors,” after operating off Lubin’s Ether stash for years on end. While this nine-figure sum is ludicrous in and of itself, the $200 million seems even crazier when you factor in the mere $21 million the firm dragged in for fiscal 2018, and that ConsenSys is seeking a valuation of “at least $1 billion.” This 50+ times revenue-to-market capitalization multiplier is, in the eyes of some prospective investors, “too high given the company’s revenues and expenses,” The Information writes while referencing the aforementioned sources. Interestingly, despite the skepticism, ConsenSys, a well-recognized industry name, seems to find its ten-figure valuation entirely justified. The group’s executives have purportedly already pitched ConsenSys to investors in Hong Kong and South Korea — two crypto hotspots — and those familiar claim that even Chinese investors are considering giving the Ethereum-centric group some cash. And with time, this could turn out to be a winning bet. Per the fundraising documents obtained by sources, ConsenSys is projecting to secure more than $50 million in revenue for fiscal 2019, 80% of which is likely to come from the firm’s services arm, which partners with corporations and governments to introduce them to blockchain technologies. While ConsenSys evidently has its head up high now, as it projects a doubling of its revenues year-over-year, the purported search for $200 million comes after a dramatic layoff. At the end of 2018, Lubin released a letter to ConsenSys’ spokes, often Ethereum decentralized application creators and infrastructure providers, revealing that the organization was to undergo a restructuring that included a layoff of 13% of the ~1,200-odd staffers. ConsenSys recent struggles only accentuate that Ethereum hasn’t been doing all too hot lately. And interestingly, many industry insiders expect for this unfortunate trend to continue into the future. Earlier this year, Fred Wilson, the co-founder of crypto-friendly Union Square Ventures, took to his world-renowned blog to claim that he expects to see Ethereum’s space in this ecosystem challenged by new competitors in 2019. This quip was followed by a near-identical comment from Kyle Samani, a partner at industry investment group Multicoin Capital, shortly thereafter. Samani specifically stated that the percentage of total developers work shift from Ethereum to newer Blockchain 3.0 platforms, such as Polkadot and Cosmos. Most recently, Tetras Capital’s Alex Sunnarborg took to Forbes to continue this narrative, claiming that the mentioned layoffs at ConsenSys, lack of users on Ethereum-based applications like Augur, and the overvaluation of certain ICOs are signs that the project is losing momentum and steam. Yet, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the project, has done his utmost to exude confidence in the midst of what some call “FUD.” In a recent Reddit thread, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur claimed that the Prysmatic, Lighthouse, Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), and so on and so forth are “still continuing work right on schedule.” But is this true? At this point, no one is all too sure.",

        "passage": "It is once again unpleasant news for the security practices of third party cryptocurrency exchanges, with reports suggesting that a Turkey-based platform has suffered a multi-million dollar hack. Whilst the name of the cryptocurrency exchange in question has not been made public, Turkish publication the Daily Sabah has reported that the cryptocurrency equivalent of more than $2.47 million has been stolen by a group of online cyber criminals. The publication continues to add that the cyber criminals behind the attack were using the hugely popular online multi-player game of PUBG to communicate with one another. Although the report of the theft has only just surfaced, we are led to believe that 24 individuals have since been arrested by Turkish authorities.  Once Turkish Police were made aware of the hack, authorities conducted a nationwide search for the suspects in question. It is believed that just $256,000 of the reported $2.47 million has been recovered thus far. As such, the recovered funds have been returned to the unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. However, due to the underlying nature of the blockchain protocol, unless Turkish Police are able to recover the private key credentials pertaining to the wallets storing the stolen funds, it remains to be seen how they will be able to recover the remaining balance. Alternatively, the suspects behind the exchange hack will need to voluntarily hand over the wallet credentials, which, if pressured to do so, could potentially result in the exchange getting their funds back. In terms of what was stolen, the report indicates that the $2.47 million consisted of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Of the 24 held individuals, it has been reported that 2 have since been released without charge. The Prosecutor’s Office for the case in question have made formal arrests for six of the suspects, with the remaining 16 subsequently released on judicial control. The hearing, which is yet to be given a date, will be held at the Istanbul Courthouse in Caglayan. It remains to be seen why Turkish authorities have decided not to release the name of the exchange that experienced the hack. First and foremost, it is argued that those who are using the Turkish-based exchange to trade have a right to know that the platform they are using has exploitable weaknesses in its underlying security safeguards. If they were made aware, they would have the option of removing their tokens. Moreover, it is also a concern that the unnamed cryptocurrency exchange did not make  news of the hack public themselves. In the vast majority of cases, cryptocurrency exchanges that have had their security safeguards breached most commonly announce the hack themselves. Whilst a failure to protect customer funds in the most appropriate of manners is a never a good thing, the issue is further amplified if the platform does not make the news of the hack public. Whilst cryptocurrency exchange hacks are nothing new, if anything, it should once again be a further reminder to those that store large quantities of funds in a third party platform. Whilst holding a balance within an exchange is no doubt a minimum requirement for those that are looking to actively trades tokens, users must ensure that that the platform has installed notable security practices to protect customer funds. At an absolute minimum, users should only store cryptocurrency holdings in a third party exchange if safeguards such as 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) or Multi-Sig log-in requirements are offered. Moreover, users should ensure that a significant proportion of the exchange’s token fund balance is held in cold storage.",

In addition, North Korea is also maliciously hacking South Korea and neighboring regions to potentially get its hands on confidential information. Recently, we reported that the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was responsible for roughly five separate cryptocurrency hacks in South Korea per data released by the cybersecurity firms Group-1B and Recorded Future.  About $882 million in cryptocurrency funds has been stolen throughout 2018, of which $571 million was allegedly taken by members of Lazarus. The organization has been blamed for attacks on digital exchanges like Yapizon, Coinrail and Bithumb, and virtually every attack’s financial loss exceeds $5 million. Lazarus was also blamed for the attack on Coincheck – one of Japan’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – in early January. Over half-a-billion in cryptocurrency funds disappeared overnight, and it’s likely the biggest disaster (and biggest embarrassment) suffered by Japan’s digital currency industry since Mt. Gox in 2014. The event set the precedent for new regulation in Japan regarding digital assets, and the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) saw themselves getting involved. The organization began sending notices out to the country’s many digital exchanges, warning them that if they didn’t step up their act and enable stronger security measures, they would ultimately be shut down. Coincheck has since begun initiating refunds for customers affected by the hack after facing considerable criticism for its hot wallet storage tactics. In recent news, a U.S. cybersecurity firm has come forth to explain that in January, it found computers installed with malware designed to mine the cryptocurrency Monero. The garnered funds later went to Kim II Sung University in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital city, suggesting the country was behind the malware’s implantation. The process is known as crypto-jacking, and involves malware being secretly downloaded onto an unsuspecting victim’s computer to use their energy as a means of extracting new coins. Although nothing new, it can have devastating effects on one’s power sources and run up a rather nasty bill for the person in question. The most recent scenario of crypto-jacking involves an Adobe Flash update that was allegedly very good at hiding its hidden mining code, as the software did exactly what it was designed to do. Users’ Adobe systems were updated, and thus no one ever suspected a thing. The malware was first noticed by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, named after a city in northern California. Over the years, cryptocurrency has emerged not only as a second form of income for North Korea, but also as a means of avoiding sanctions implemented by countries like the United States. Furthermore, the National Intelligence Service is saying that North Korea is preparing itself for a visit from international nuclear experts scheduled to examine the country’s Punggyeri nuclear test site. Leader Kim Jong Un invited journalists from all over the world to swing by and report on the dismantling of the site last May. The move is labeled a “major step towards denuclearization.” Now that the site has been removed, Jong Un is inviting the appropriate personnel to ensure the safety and low radiation levels of the dismantled operation. An intelligence officer familiar with the circumstances of the upcoming visit explains:",

        "passage": "The official manufacturer behind leading cryptocurrency hardware wallet Trezor has announced that it believes criminals are using a new method to steal funds from unsuspecting victims. The post, released on Medium by Satoshi Labs, the company behind the Trezor brand, stated that they have been made aware that “one-to-one copies” of Trezor are circulating the market. As the post states, “In other words, a fake Trezor device, manufactured by a different, unknown vendor” has been discovered. SatoshiLabs continue to add that whilst Trezor clones have been operating in the market for some time now, not only do they are utilize a different brand name, but they are also manufactured by legitimate organizations. As such, the process of distinguishing between a real Trezor and a clone is a simple one. However, a new breed of fake Trezor’s have been discovered.  They are believed to be practically identical to the original product, much in the same way that counterfeit apparel products attempt to deceive loyal brand purchasers. Much like in the case of counterfeit apparel products, the unknown manufacturer is offering their fake Trezor at a price vastly lower that the original. The Trezor team add that on top of a significantly lower price tag, it is also possible to ascertain whether you might have a fake device by looking at the product’s attached hologram. By uploading images and a video, the post allows users to check their hologram to ensure they have a legitimate product.  As the Trezor team have only recently been made aware of the illicit flood of fakes, it is yet to be acknowledged how many are currently circulating. The key concern for those affected is what capabilities the seller has regarding stored funds.  Under normal circumstances, Trezor devices (along with other leading hardware devices) are the most secure way of protecting yourself against the threats of external malpractice. Even if the device was subsequently lost, or worse, stolen, then the thief would still have limited, if any access to the victim’s funds. The key reason for this is that in order to facilitate a movement of funds out of the wallet, the user is required to enter a physical PIN number that was set by the owner of the device. Furthermore, each subsequently incorrect PIN combination activates the time-lock, meaning the user has to wait a certain amount of time before they can try again. Brute force would simply render the device redundant. During this time, the victim would have the ability to recover their funds remotely, by using their back-up passphrase.  Read: Trezor vs Ledger Review However, if the aforementioned fake Trezor devices are as innovative as the physical design of the product, then there could be further complications. One such possibility is that the illicit manufacturer creates the device in such a manner that allows them to remotely access the user’s balance. This could be extremely costly, especially when one considers that hardware devices are generally used for larger cryptocurrency holdings. Nevertheless, this should be a stark reminder to those looking to get a cheap deal on hardware wallet devices. As echoed by the manufacturers themselves, you should only ever buy a Trezor device from an official channel. In most cases, this is either directly from the Trezor website or via an officially licensed third party, such as Amazon. The Trezor product has grown significantly since its launch in 2014, selling over a million devices along the way. It remains to be seen whether the announcement will instill fear in future buyers.",

A couple of liquidators from Grant Thornton have already been tasked with the job of security assets belonging to stakeholders of the company. Cryptopia joins others like Mt. Gox in failing to recover from a cyber attack. Meanwhile, experts continue to warn cryptocurrency traders to recognize the risks associated with participating in the market.  According to the NZ Herald, Russell Moore and David Roscoe of Grant Thornton will be in charge of overseeing the liquidation process. Cryptopia lost close to $23 million in cryptocurrency from the January 2019 heist. An excerpt from a statement issued by Roscoe reads: The statement goes on further to say that a resolution to the matter might take months given the “complexities involved.” The liquidators say there are working with independent experts to ascertain the full extent of Cryptopia’s obligations to its creditors. The January 2019 hack appears to have impacted the platform significantly to the extent that it may not be able to recover. The top hierarchy at the company reportedly tried to downsize its staff strength but despite running a skeleton crew, Cryptopia couldn’t return to profitable business operations. On Tuesday (May 14, 2019), the company informed shareholders of its decision to shut down. The Cryptopia premises in Sydenham, Christchurch is also under lock and key with reports saying the building looks like a ghost town. As previously reported by Blockonomi, the platform had tried to resume services, starting in early March 2019 with a read-only website. At the time, users reported that they were being subject to a “haircut” on their cryptocurrency holdings as the platform tried to recover from the loss. Cryptopia now joins Mt. Gox and QuadrigaCX to name a few, as cryptocurrency exchanges forced to shut down following financial difficulties. Back in 2014, the now-defunct Tokyo-based MT. Gox suffered a devastating hack of almost $500 million in Bitcoin and never recovered. At the time, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world but now is undergoing civil rehabilitation to pay off creditors affected in the hack. For QuadrigaCX, the situation is a little more bizarre. Gerald Cotten, the CEO of the company passed away without handing over the keys to the platform’s cold wallets to his next-of-kin. Once Canada’s largest Bitcoin exchange platform, QuadrigaCX is also pursuing a similar course of action to Cryptopia. Whether on account of hacking, unfriendly government policies, poor business practices or some other extenuating set of circumstances, cryptocurrency exchanges run the risk of going out of business. For these reasons, many experts say traders need to exercise caution when trading virtual currencies on these platforms. The absence of deposit-guarantee by many exchanges means that traders run the risk of losing their investments should anything go wrong. The establishment of trusted cryptocurrency custodians and insurers could go a long way in diminishing these risk factors. Fidelity Investments has plans to providing robust cryptocurrency custodial tools even as it gears up to begin offering Bitcoin trading to its institutional clients. Cryptocurrency startups like Coinbase and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle also have their own custody platforms. Bakkt, the cryptocurrency derivatives platform owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) also reportedly wants to become a licensed virtual currency custodian.",

        "passage": "Lionel Messi – the Barcelona playmaker that is often described as the most naturally talented Soccer player of all time, is to endorse the world’s first blockchain mobile phone, as reported by UK newspaper The Independent. The organization behind the project, Swiss-Israeli-startup Sirin Labs, claim to specialize in multi-layer cyber security through the utilization of blockchain technology. The smartphone, which is labeled as the “Finney”, is supported by a Google Certified fork of Android, which it calls Sirin OS. On top of having the underlying technology secured by blockchain technology, the Finney handset will also will also have a cold wallet application that allows users to safely store their cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the in-built Sirin app store will facilitate a range of decentralized applications (dApps). One such example is a dApp that will allow Finney users to exchange mobile data or battery power in return for digital tokens.  The Finney is set for an official launch date of November 29th, with an estimated price-tag of $1,000. Sirin Labs have already had success in the smartphone space, with the 2016 launch of their “Solarin”. The device, which was at the time labeled as the “world’s most secure phone“, retailed for a substantial $16,000. The Solarin project also had an A-list celebrity tie, with both Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio attending the London premier launch event. With the endorsement of Messi – who by the way, has just under 90 million Facebook followers, is excellent news for the cryptocurrency industry, insofar that it further supports the long-term goal of mass awareness. However, it is also important to note that the marketing strategy of employing a celebrity to endorse a blockchain-related project does not necessarily guarantee success. For example, in late 2017, Floyd Mayweather, who is often dubbed as the best “Pound-for-Pound” boxer of all time, endorsed the now defunct initial coin offering of Centra Coin. The project – which claimed to provide a gateway for users to spend cryptocurrencies via a Visa or MasterCard backed debit card, raised close to $32 million before being shut down by U.S. regulators. It remains to be seen how much money the project would have raised without the endorsement of Mayweather, however it is highly likely that his link to the ICO created an element of artificial legitimacy. Then there was the case of John McAfee, the controversial founder of McAfee anti-virus software. McAfee recently admitted that he charged close to $100,000 to Tweet support for up and coming cryptocurrency projects, subsequently motivating unsuspecting individuals to invest in the recommended token. Nevertheless, recognizing the slightly dampened history of celebrity endorsed blockchain projects, the team at Sirin Labs state that “If you’ve followed Messi’s career at all, you’d know he doesn’t just put his name on anything to make a buck,” Announcements such as the Finney product further illustrates the fact that although the cryptocurrency markets have been somewhat bearish since the turn of late 2017, much is going on behind the scenes. Whilst the value of most cryptocurrency portfolios are worth a fraction of what they were just 12 months prior, blockchain entities are churning out new and exciting ventures across multiple industries, indicating that the phenomenon is far from a short-term fad. However, it remains to be seen just how long global adoption will take, especially when one considers the vast amount of projects now in existence. Sirin Labs raised more than $157 million during their late-2017 ICO, with $110 million of this  received in the first 24 hours. However, as with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, the Sirin Labs token has lost the vast majority of its value since it was issued. Reaching a remarkable all-time high of just over $320 million at the start of the year, the token currently has a total market capitalization of $18 million.",

        "passage": "It is difficult to think of a better market for blockchain than online freelancing. Today some estimate the amount earned by online freelance professionals at nearly 2 trillion dollars. Regardless of the exact amount, the space has grown substantial over the last decade. Platforms like UpWork and Freelancer are currently in the top spots, but blockchain could change all that over the next few years. There are issues for online freelancers that blockchain could easily address. Making sure that payment is secure for a freelancer is sometimes problematic. There are sites like UpWork that will hold money in escrow, but this is expensive, and isn’t a perfect system.  Blockchain can also help freelancers to build up a solid reputation, that doesn’t rely on a third-party website to verify their credentials. There are numerous ways that a person can defraud a client, and claim responsibility for work they never did. Blockchain can create a secure record of authorship, so that clients know they are hiring a professional that can get the job done. Zoom is on the cusp of releasing a blockchain-based freelancing platform that would tap into the potential that DLT tech could bring to a massive market. They are working on a platform that could replace a site like UpWork, and offer additional benefits as well. Zoom would use smart-contracts to make sure that freelancers would get paid, but they would also use blockchain to match freelancers with potentially perfect jobs. Zoom CEO, Plamen Nedyalkovis, commented to Venture Beat on the benefits that his company would offer in the payment space: Clients would also benefit from using Zoom. The platform was created with multi-party projects in mind, and allows numerous groups to participate in forming a single entity to manage a complex workflow. They would also benefit from the skills-matching feature of the platform, as clients would be saved from sorting through piles of talent. Moonlighting is another freelancing platform that is embracing blockchain. While Moonlighting is still a relatively small company when compared to UpWork or Freelancer, they have grown significantly since they launched in 2014. They are working on a new round of fundraising, and plan to use some of the proceeds to integrate blockchain into their already successful platform. Jeff Tennery, one of the founders of Moonlighting, had this to say about the capital raise: Many of the people that have entered both the online freelancing and blockchain space are passionate about what they do. It is easy to see that Jeff Tennery is probably sees a value in Moonlighting that is more than financial. Many in the blockchain space have similar feelings, and are looking for new ways to organize social structures. No matter how they are employed, smart-contracts are a great tool for online freelancing. Some freelancers may prefer to work through an organized system, like the one that Zoom or Moonlighting is developing, while others could find that a platform that allows smart-contacts to be drafted easily is a better fit. It is likely that the same advantages that blockchain offers other industries will be realized in freelancing. Unlike banking and FinTech, start-ups like Zoom have far fewer regulatory hurdles to overcome. Sites like UpWork may want to keep an eye on blockchain-based freelancing technology, as they will have to compete with these platforms once they are operational.",

It appears Bitsane, a cryptocurrency exchange platform based out of Dublin, has ceased its operations and disappeared with users funds, per a Forbes report.  But there were warning signs. According to the report, users had witnessed multiple issues with withdrawals as far back as May 2019. Some weeks after, Bitsane deletes its social media accounts, shuts down its servers and disappeared. In addition to that, Bitsane’s trading information on CoinMarketCap has also not been updated for the past 10 days. All signs point to the fact that Bitsane just kiboshed and vanished into thin air. Multiple user groups on Facebook and Telegram have seen various complaints lodged, with customers claiming to have lost crypto assets valued anywhere from $5,000 to $150,000.  According to the report, an anonymous user said, “I was trying to transfer XRP out to Bitcoin or cash or anything, and it kept saying ‘temporarily disabled.’ I knew right away there was some kind of problem. I went back in to try to look at those tickets to see if they were still pending, and you could no longer access Bitsane.” Bitsane was established back in 2016, and it has been providing spot trading capabilities for numerous cryptocurrencies ever since. The company gained notoriety as one of the first exchanges to partner with Ripple Labs and offer crypto trading in XRP. It has continued to grow since then, with data on CoinMarketCap showing Bitsane had about 246,000 registered users and a daily trading volume in excess of $7 million. However, even with all its considerable popularity, it would seem that the exchange’s operators have now pulled a Houdini on their customers. While there could be various reasons why the exchange would suddenly disappear, the consensus is that its operators were con artists who simply waited for the perfect time to elope with users’ funds. This looks like QuadrigaCX with a different national flag. Ireland isn’t known to be particularly crypto-averse, and it has witnessed a lot of involvement in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Most notable is the expansion of Coinbase’s Debit Card into the country, along with five other European nations. Earlier this year, three major Irish banks also partnered with auditing giant Deloitte to run a pilot on the Ethereum blockchain-based data management platform. Blockchain courses are also being taught in tertiary institutions. The Dublin City University joined forces with Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet to develop a Blockchain Master’s Degree course in May. So, it’s pretty evident that the country has a solid relationship with the blockchain technology. While a lot of crypto exchanges tend to shut down operations and close shop due to stringent regulations from their home governments, this couldn’t have been the case for Bitsane. Any argument of a government crackdown is thus rendered mute. For now, it’s a bit too early to say what caused Bitsane to vanish. However, there’s a really slim chance that its operators would be found.",

Prior to the announcement, customers of Coinbase were stuck dealing with limits on their account holdings, while purchases often took as long as five days to complete.  The company wrote in a blog post: In addition, customers were once limited to weekly spending amounts of $25,000. That figure has since become the daily limit, which means customers could now purchase close to $200,000 per week if they wanted. The company has released a statement, explaining: Coinbase has been one of the most active digital currency exchanges as of late. The venture recently announced that Ethereum Classic – a coin that resulted from an Ethereum hard fork in 2016 after roughly $3.6 million in ether tokens were stolen by hackers – was being added to its trading platform. This caused a subsequent price hike of nearly 30 percent for the currency. Furthermore, representatives also state that they are considering the addition of five more coins. Lastly, decentralized cryptocurrency startup dYdX is launching new tokens designed to “short Ethereum” and offer crypto traders exposure to something that founder Antonio Juliano considers “more diverse.” The venture’s efforts are being funded by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Juliano commented: Coinbase’s new perks come with some fine print. Only verified users will be able to take advantage of the new features, while debit cards will experience lowered limits of approximately $7,500 a week. If users want to deposit more, they will need to do so through bank transfers. Coinbase explained in its blog that users who have not yet completed the verification process “will be required to do so before having access to instant purchases, new trading limits and the ability to withdraw or send coins off-platform.” In the U.K., customers can also look forward to making deposits in pound sterling through the company’s partnership with Faster Payments. Users can also look forward to lower fees, and less-restrictive limitations that allow transactions of up to 250,000 pounds. While Coinbase has yet to say when, exactly, these new perks will be available, they say users can expect them sometime next month.",

Tusar’s company analyzes liquidity between different exchanges and provides market information to clients including high-profile investors and hedge funds. It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is in an odd state. We’re failing to properly regulate, working against scams and threats, stigmas, and more. Tusar understands the overall skepticism, and knows that no one group can help clients work out cryptocurrencies “from beginning to end.” He claims that exchanges need to cater to all aspects of the market, alongside educate investors on the ins and outs: After 13 years at Goldman Sachs, Tusar definitely has knowledge on the subject. As global head of electronic trading, the now CTO commented on regulations, markets, and more as the face of the company. He was even pronounced partner in 2008. Between Tagomi and Goldman, Tusar worked at KCG Holdings in New York as head of client market making and execution, before heading up as CEO at Greywolf Consulting. What’s interesting about Tagomi Holdings is it comes in the middle of a long-running bearish market. In fact, it’s predicted that the market may fall even harder, with Bitcoin hitting a low of $1,500. It doesn’t help that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is refusing Bitcoin ETFs thanks to insecurity and lack of regulation regarding the asset.

Every emerging market goes through a tight space before becoming successful. It’s vital that we continue to engage investors, start new companies, push blockchain use cases, and more to keep interest high and the industry going. In fact, some might argue that this early stage is the best time to get involved. Right now, we’re seeing innovation across the board despite all of the scams and bad press surrounding cryptocurrencies.",

        "passage": "An Indian tech firm is currently developing a blockchain settlements layer for banks in Thailand. The infrastructure will enable the participating banks to form an interbank network that will allow payment settlements using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Thailand is the latest in a growing list of countries actively developing financial protocols built on decentralized ledger technology (DLT). The news is yet another positive development for the Southeast Asian country in its quest to adopt cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  According to Business Insider, Indian tech firm, Wipro is building a blockchain settlements protocol for eight banks in Thailand. This settlements layer will allow the use of cryptocurrency in interbank transactions. The blockchain infrastructure is part of Project Inthanon – Thailand’s CBDC pilot. Announcing the development in a statement published on Tuesday (May 7, 2019), Wipro said: For Thailand, the introduction of a CBDC isn’t about creating a new national cryptocurrency but to optimize the efficiency of back-office operations in its banking sector. The overall goal is to reduce the cost of banking by replacing intermediary third-party protocols with trustless systems. Thai banking regulators also hope the adoption of blockchain technology will improve the security of the nation’s banking infrastructure. Banks in Thailand have suffered data breaches affecting hundreds of thousands of customers. If successful, the blockchain settlements layer currently being jointly developed by Wipro and R3 could see DLT being employed in Thailand’s interbank settlement infrastructure. Thailand is one of 40 nations actively trying to utilize blockchain technology across several industries. Recently, reports emerged that Iran’s central bank was in partnership with Areatak, a Tehran-based blockchain startup to create a national DLT infrastructure for the country’s financial sector. Project Borna as it is called in Iran will see commercial banks and fintech startups offering competitive services on a blockchain layer being developed based on IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric. The news of the blockchain-based interbank settlements layer comes at a time when Thailand is increasingly adopting the emerging digital economy. Since laying the legal and legislative groundwork in 2018, the Southeast Asian nation has continued to lead the way in creating an enabling environment for the cryptocurrency landscape. As previously reported by Blockonomi, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced updates to the country’s Securities and Exchange Act of 2019. This amended Act will see the inclusion of security token offerings in the primary market. In mid-March 2019, the Thai Sec gave its approval for the first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) portal. Rather than clamping down on crypto commerce, Thai regulators continue to focus on building a robust legal infrastructure for blockchain businesses. Meanwhile, India despite being open to blockchain technology continues to come down hard on cryptocurrency. Unlike other countries exploring CBDC’s the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shelved its own plans without issuing any details of the study conducted on the matter. There are even reports that the government is looking to completely ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Back in 2018, the RBI prohibited banks from offering services to Bitcoin exchanges leading to the departure of many such companies. The RBI even excluded cryptocurrencies from its recently published fintech regulatory sandbox.",

        "passage": "One of France’s top banking powerhouses has turned to the Ethereum network to release bonds in the form of security tokens. Societe Generale, or SocGen as it’s commonly referred to in France, is presently the 19th largest in the world, the sixth largest in Europe, and the third largest in its home country. On April 23rd, the firm announced it had issued €100 million EUR in bonds — formally called “obligations de financement de l’habitat” — as security tokens, or OFH tokens, via Ethereum.  The initiative comes as part of a collaboration between SocGen Group and in internal startup at the bank, Societe Generale FORGE, with the latter being focused on “using blockchain technology to develop new digital capital market activities.”  Notably, and toward that last point, the bank cast the pivot to a security token model as one that could improve upon various aspects of the bond issuance process in traditional markets: The use case is the latest institutional example of what the Ethereum network is being focused toward, namely becoming next-generation public infrastructure for commerce and beyond. And if this tokenization effort can achieve the bond improvements that SocGen is touting, other mainstream banks will be sure to follow. The OFH tokens are mainstream themselves, with the bonds having been given Triple A ratings from top credit rating agencies like Fitch and Moody’s. Bonds are used to raise capital, but creating them has been a paper-intensive process hitherto. If the march of tokenization continues on, then bonds as security tokens may simply become the status quo. SocGen’s issuance of the OFH tokens is the latest security token offering (STO) in Europe, but it’s not the first this year. Last month, cryptocurrency lending firm Bitbond released Germany’s inaugural STO in its Bitbond Token (BB1). Unlike the loan-like structure of SocGen’s bonds, the BB1 token, which has a lifespan of 10 years, gives its holders rights to Bitbond dividends. Also unlike the OFH tokens, the BB1 was built atop the Stellar platform rather than Ethereum. On their token’s landing page, the Bitbond team explained their rationale for picking the former: On a related note, German fintech startup wevest AG declared last week that it would also be relying on the Stellar platform in order to facilitate the company’s own security token operations. “The efficiencies Stellar provides will be instrumental in furthering wevest’s mission to help SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] gain access to equity financing,” the company said. The Bitbond and wevest Stellar embraces show that Ethereum will not go unchallenged in the cryptoeconomy as the stakes of enterprise token efforts continue to increase around the globe. Though for now, Ethereum is still the most popular blockchain project for issuing tokens. Wherever the tokenization rat race goes from here, European states have generally been more less strict on security tokens than the United States, where the leadership of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suggested it sees most token projects as securities.",

        "passage": "One of the minds behind the Lightning Network — Bitcoin’s proposed second-layer scaling solution — has just authored a paper formally outlining another method for optimizing the reigning public blockchain. That mind, Tadge Dryja, is a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative. He’s renowned in the cryptoverse for having co-published the Lightning whitepaper with Joseph Poon in 2016.  His newest contribution to the cryptocurrency scaling arena? Utreexo, a so-called accumulator, which would slim down unspent transaction output (UTXO) sets, or the state, for Bitcoin full nodes. The result of the slimming would be making such full nodes easier and less costly to run, i.e. slowing the usage of storage space.  To that end, Utreexo can be used to streamline validating in Bitcoin. As Dryja explained of the system: Indeed, Utreexo and methods like it could pave the way to users eventually running Bitcoin full nodes straight from their smartphones. The idea for accumulators have been around for more than two decades, and Dryja’s Utreexo isn’t the only accumulator work that’s been pursued in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to date — for example, leading researchers at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University have had their own relevant ideas. Yet Dryja’s Utreexo whitepaper suggests the long sought tech is closer to reality than ever, and his methodology is likely to usher in a new wave of accumulator research in the space. And that means full nodes may imminently be getting lighter and lighter. As Benedikt Bünz, one of those aforementioned Stanford researchers, has previously commented on accumulator-focused innovation: Now that Utreexo is open for review, it may only be a matter of time until a wallet project first implements the tech. For some, the Lightning Network and block size increases are the predominant possible avenues for scaling Bitcoin. But they aren’t the only avenues. Alternative and contribution solutions, like Utreexo, are rising. Another one of these alternative solutions? Statechains, a new and trusted scaling protocol.  Authored by Seoul Bitcoin Meetup founder Ruben Somsen, statechains are not a competing solution to Lightning but could rather work in parallel as coordinated off-chain systems. As Somsen explained in a recent introductory post on the tech: Somsen went on to add that, “in a nutshell this is the core concept, and […] it’s deceptively powerful.” As the Lightning Network’s progress continues to hum along, Bolt Labs is angling to boost the second-layer scaling solution’s privacy. The startup raised $1.5 million USD in April to further its mission of using the BOLT Protocol to bring anonymous shielded addresses to users of Lightning, ZCash, and beyond. Bolt Labs’s founder Dr. Ayo Akinyele has said BOLT can make it so “no one can link you to [a] payment unless you disclose the information.” Thus with the march of innovations like BOLT, Utreexo, and statechains, second-layer infrastructure is steadily blooming in multiple directions.",

The developments come after Ledger’s Nano S received a security certificate from France’s top cybersecurity watchdog earlier this month, making Ledger the first crypto wallet manufacturer to receive any such kind of government certification.  Previously limited to a consultation-only mode, the Ledger Live mobile app has now been entirely opened up for Android users. Users of the Android 7.0 operating system and beyond can now use the Ledger Live app to view their cryptocurrency holdings and facilitate Nano S transactions right from their phones. The wallet manufacturer noted that iOS users will still only be able to use the mobile app’s consultation mode due to “technical limitations.” In their announcement, the Ledger team characterized the production as another step toward using smartphones to help bring crypto into the mainstream: On March 26th, Ledger and EMURGO — the enterprise wing of the Cardano ecosystem — declared that the hardware wallet manufacturer had integrated support for ADA, the Cardano blockchain’s native asset, on the Ledger Nano S.  On the news, Ledger’s social media team called ADA “possibly the most requested crypto by our community.” The integration will make it possible for holders to use their Nano S alongside the EMURGO-backed Yoroi wallet or the open-source ADALite wallet. Commenting on the move, Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque noted how ADA support had been particularly long-awaited in light of the Cardano project’s rise to prominence since 2017: As for Cardano itself, its builders just released the blockchain’s v1.5 software, which notably is the last big upgrade before the project enters its major Shelly development period. Last week, Ledger announced its Nano S wallet had received a security certification from the National Agency for Information Systems Security, or ANSSI, France’s top cybersecurity watchdog that answers to the nation’s Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security.  The certification, also known as the First Level Security Certificate, comes as part of a “process for undergoing evaluation across several categories, including firewall, identification, authentication and access, secure communications and embedded software,” Ledger noted. Accordingly, a lab deployed by ANSSI tested the Nano S and determined it to have superior security against various relevant attack vectors. The development makes Ledger the first known hardware wallet manufacturer to receive such government certification, a reality that the company will use to press its claim as being the industry’s de facto wallet leader in more than just sales. The French company also declared it would work to ascertain the First Level Security Certificate for its other devices beyond the Nano S, like the Blue and the Nano X.",

        "passage": "Crypto settlement plays like Ripple be warned — banking goliath JP Morgan is aiming to launch new settlement functionalities on its interbank blockchain rail, the Interbank Information Network (IIN), in the third quarter of 2019. The advancement was confirmed by the firm’s head of global clearing, John Hunter, who told the Financial Times per an April 21st report that the IIN’s settlement pivot was meant to address antiquated bank processing flows. As much as 20 percent of contemporary bank payments stall because of minor compliance errors, he noted. Resolving these errors often entails a long, winding process as multiple institutions have to manually coordinate on resolutions.  The IIN’s new settlement functionalities will be aimed at giving participant banks — of which there are more than 200 to date — the ability to considerably reduce the time necessary for such resolutions by offering real-time validation that transaction details are correct. The IIN is built on Quorum, a private or permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain that’s been developed by JP Morgan since 2016. In recent years, private blockchain skeptics have openly challenged the viability of permissioned blockchains when compared to the alternative of using regular databases or public blockchains privately. Yet Hunter’s new revelations show JP Morgan has done much more than just make their mind up in that debate — and their IIN vision has already won a couple hundred takers to the firm’s side to boot. The development also marks the intensification of competition for cryptoverse-native payments settlements plays like Ripple and Stellar, which are respectively gunning to make their own enterprise leaps toward the mainstream. The ramping up of the IIN’s settlement possibilities comes after JP Morgan announced back in February it would be releasing a stablecoin-like token, the JPM Coin, via Quorum. The firm declared the token would be pegged to the U.S. dollar and would be unfurled in preliminary payment settlement trials in 2019. JP Morgan isn’t aiming small with the token, either. The bank’s blockchain lead Umar Farooq noted at the time of JPM Coin’s announcement that the eventual reach of the project was, in effect, wide open. On the flip side, analysts qualified the announcement in saying JPM Coin wouldn’t be a cryptocurrency per se because its source was the permissioned Quorum — not to mention that cash deposits must be made to JP Morgan to an receive an associated number of coins. Even still, in JPM Coin and in the IIN, JP Morgan is inviting other major enterprises to dip their toes into blockchain tech in high-level ways. The firm is reportedly planning to let companies experiment with building apps on the IIN later this year. For now, there’s no word on how, or if, the token and the interbank will be used in tandem, though that dynamic seems highly likely. Moreover, it’s also worth mentioning that JP Morgan is a stakeholder in the public blockchain ecosystem. This month, the firm joined the Token Taxonomy Initiative, which is seeking to standardize tokenization practices to facilitate enterprise adoption of crypto. JP Morgan has also been engaging with tech that has been designed to conceal transactions details on the Ethereum network, suggesting the banking powerhouse doesn’t intend to wholly sequester activity on the private Quorum platform from Ethereum. That’s because the firm has been testing the zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) of the London-based AZTEC team. Another possibility the bank could look at is Nightfall — a new privacy protocol for the public Ethereum network that’s been developed and released into the public domain by “Big Four” accounting giant EY.",

        "passage": "On July 30th, the Ethereum community’s stakeholders celebrated the blockchain network’s fourth birthday. Frontier, the inaugural live version of Ethereum, first launched on that date in 2014. At the time, the network formally transitioned from the 1,028,201st block of the proof-of-concept Olympic testnet to the genesis block of Ethereum.  With that milestone, miners began securing the network and developers began working on Ethereum smart contracts and dapps, some of which have gone on to become quite popular in the cryptoeconomy today.  “During the Frontier release, we expect early adopters and application developers to establish communities and start forming a live ecosystem,” former Ethereum chief communications officer Stephan Tual wrote presciently just days before activation. “Like their counterparts during the American Frontier, these settlers will be presented with vast opportunities, but will also face many dangers. The blockchain’s fourth birthday — which specifically arrived at block 8,252,752 — also comes on the heels of the Ethereum community having celebrated the fifth anniversary of the ether (ETH) pre-sale, which began on July 22nd, 2014.  The 42-day crowdsale saw more than 31,500 bitcoin exchanged for over 60 million ether, which then traded for approximately $0.35 each. Since then, the Ethereum blockchain and its associated cryptocurrency have gone on to become major forces within the cryptoeconomy, with the Ethereum development community currently being the space’s largest. As for ETH, it’s currently hovering at a market capitalization of $23.4 billion and a price of $209. Notably, ETH traded as high as $1,431 each during the peak of the last crypto bull market in January 2018. To understand how quickly Ethereum has come along, you have to understand where it’s been. In November 2013, Vitalik Buterin started circulating a whitepaper for the project, an “all-purpose computational platform for smart contracts,” to around a dozen peers. Some of these peers dove in, and the project began to take on life. Less than one month after Buterin’s whitepaper email, developer Gavin Wood made the first commit in the Ethereum repository. Buterin publicly revealed the project to much intrigue at the North American Bitcoin Conference in January 2014. Fast forward to that summer, and the ether pre-sale began. In the spring of 2015, the final preparatory Olympic testnet launched. Less than two months later Frontier was activated, ushering in Ethereum’s genesis block. The first production-ready release of the network, Homestead, went live the following March. In June 2016, the Ethereum community faced its first major crisis when an unknown hacker compromised The DAO investment fund and started draining out its ether. The blockchain was forked that month to protect investors’ funds, leading to the Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic (ETC) schism. In 2017, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was formed, the ICO phenomenon acutely boomed, and the ether price surged before drawing down considerably throughout 2018. Now, with buy pressure and regulatory stakes heightened in the cryptoeconomy, ether and its native blockchain have pressed closer to the mainstream and big enterprises have taken notice. All eyes now turn to Ethereum’s biggest evolutionary transition to date: the coming multi-phase Serenity upgrade. That upgrade will see the Ethereum network shift to proof-of-stake consensus via Casper FFG tech and toward the scaling innovations of sharding and Plasma. Last month, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake floated the possibility of launching the initial “Phase Zero” of Serenity on January 3rd, 2020. While that tentative suggestion may end up being impractical, it indicates the start of “ETH 2.0” is now just around the corner and likely to go down in the first half of 2020. The next thing to keep an eye on is when the deposit contract for the Beacon Chain of Phase Zero is launched. Drake has previously raised the idea of activating that contract at this year’s Devcon 5 conference in Osaka, Japan.",

        "passage": "Since the rise of consumer electronics, especially with smartphones in the past decade, financial technology has become a hot industry. As a result, online banking and digital invoices have become the norm. One analyst, however, predicts that China will take this trend one massive step further, and will convert its entire fiat system to a digital ecosystem, which may be a cryptocurrency based on a private blockchain.  In a recent appearance on Bloomberg TV, Don Tapscott, the co-founder and Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute in Canada, argued that the Chinese government and central bank could turn the Renminbi (RMB), also known as the Yuan, into a cryptocurrency with time. Speaking in response to a question about decentralized crypto exchanges and mining in China, which local authorities are reportedly looking to crack down on, Tapscott, the co-author of all-encompassing blockchain primer “The Blockchain Revolution,” postulated that the reason why the government won’t ban the aforementioned industries is because in “20 years, we are not going to be using Bitcoin in China.” Instead, he claims, locals will be using a cryptocurrency created by the central bank of China, as this would provide more control and efficiency for authorities. While Tapscott finds his argument logical, Agustin Carstens, the general manager at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has remarked that central banks and governments should not issue their own cryptocurrencies. Carstens, a staunch critic of decentralized cryptocurrencies who once called Bitcoin a “bubble, Ponzi scheme, and an environmental disaster” (in one breath no less),  said last month that such initiatives may backfire. As Bloomberg claimed, the skeptic suggested that what he called central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs) would change macroeconomic trends, like interest rates, shifts in central bank balance sheets, and market liquidity at large. Carstens explained: But there may be a reason for China to go ahead with tokenizing/fully digitizing its national currency. As Hasu and Three Arrow Capital’s Su Zhu, who are both crypto industry researchers, explained in a blog post, PayPal, Venmo, and China’s WeChat by extension “remove every need for cash,” as they’re marketed as faster, cheaper, and more efficient forms of payment. While this sounds all well and good in a convenience-seeking world, a nation where all transactions are digital will allow the government to comb through the ins and outs of every citizen’s life, giving them the ability to control and watch society with a Lord Sauron-esque eye. This will promote “surveillance, financial control, and authoritarianism.” And as seen with China’s recent push to establish a “social credit” system, whereas each citizen is ranked based on how they live their lives and the data their devices output, a fully digital, government-backed currency seems to be begging to join that system. But there’s an answer to this existential crisis if the need ever arises: Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency, unlike its centralized counterparts, is not only non-inflationary, but it is also decentralized, non-sovereign, censorship-resistant, and private. The last part there is, in the eyes of BitMEX chief executive Arthur Hayes, what makes Bitcoin especially valuable. Hayes once wrote that as privacy is an integral part of any well-function society, a system like Bitcoin will become more than essential in a society where cash is all but decimated. Zhu and Hasu would agree, as the two wrote that while Bitcoin is viable as a digital store of value, it’s best used as a new breed of money — digital cash, “that combines the benefits of physical cash with the benefits of digital payments.”",

        "passage": "The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, America’s top executive official on all things USD, just cast another round of shade at bitcoin. Are the biting comments far too bold to be fair, though? Sec. Mnuchin, who in a press conference last week called cryptocurrencies like bitcoin a “national security threat,” made his latest anti-BTC remarks in an early June 24th interview on the CNBC “Squawk Box” program.  When asked whether he’d be talking about or owning bitcoin in the coming years, U.S. President Trump’s foremost economic adviser derided the idea: To be sure, Mnuchin will most certainly have many non-cryptocurrency priorities in the years ahead. But if the bitcoin price is anywhere above its current position of $10,000 USD one decade from now, it will have have been worth the secretary of the treasury’s time to have paid closer attention — in more ways than one.  During the same CNBC interview, the Treasury Secretary pushed back against the notion he had a “weak dollar policy,” arguing that Sec. Mnuchin’s latest characterization of bitcoin as non-viable echoes comments President Trump notably made earlier this month in a tweetstorm where he bashed cryptocurrencies, characterizing them as non-money that are hotbeds for criminal activity. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” the president wrote at the time. As far as the aforementioned criminality angle goes, it’s an ironic and unnuanced position for the president to make, seeing as how U.S. dollars underpin an untold number of crimes across the globe day in and day out. No one likes that, but that’s the nature of money. Sec. Mnuchin himself argued last week that dollars weren’t commonly used in criminal transactions, an incorrect assertion made much to the chagrin of many cryptoeconomy stakeholders. When Sec. Mnuchin says he won’t be holding bitcoin in a decade, he’s implicitly making two suggestions. The first is that he doesn’t think bitcoin will survive in any meaningful way going forward. The second is his belief the dollar will remain dominant enough that he won’t have to care about BTC even if it does survive. Perhaps the top USD defender should zoom out a tad, though. Even if it takes bitcoin price the next 10 years to hit its all-time high of $20,000 again, that would mark a triumph far greater than what the current secretary of the treasury has seemingly suggested is possible for the cryptocurrency. Another angle to consider is this: President Trump has recently been openly lobbying for the Federal Reserve, America’s central banking system, to print more USD to keep up with the “big currency manipulation game” he argues China and the European Union are undertaking with their fiat currencies. It’s not that the president’s vision will win out here unrestrained. But if the dollar keeps up its inflationary trajectory and that trajectory continues to steepen, then bitcoin may continue to gain attention as a deflationary safe haven asset that has, at least to date, been generally uncorrelated with the performance of mainstream financial instruments.",

        "passage": "This week, Nasdaq, the company that runs the world’s second-largest stock market, announced a dissemination relationship with Brave New Coin that will see two cryptocurrency indices added to the sprawling Nasdaq Global Index Data ServiceSM, or GIDS, the company’s “premier real-time datafeed,” on February 25th, 2019. The indices, the Bitcoin Liquid Index and the Ethereum Liquid Index, will allow traders and institutions to track the prices of bitcoin and ether in order to make it easier to “evaluate investments and track portfolios.”  “The Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) are each designed to provide a real-time spot or reference rate for the price of 1 BTC and 1 ETH respectively, quoted in USD, and based on the most liquid ends of their markets,” the Nasdaq team said in the relationship announcement. The BLX and ELX, which will both have spot-rate frequency intervals of 30 seconds, will join tens of thousands of other mainstream indices on GIDS, which monitors 20 different index series covering global equities, commodities, and beyond. In this light, the price valuations of two of the cryptoeconomy’s top assets have taken another tangible step forward toward mainstream significance. Nasdaq Inc., which presently bears a market capitalization above $10 trillion USD, has been making increased overtures toward the cryptocurrency space in recent months. In January, Forbes reporter Michael del Castillo revealed the company at that point had seen seven cryptocurrency exchanges start using its enterprise-grade surveillance tech product after the exchanges had successfully passed a “due diligence process.” Brave New Coin, a cryptocurrency-centric data research company with offices in Auckland, London, Melbourne, and New York, also offers BNC Custom Indices, which can be used to track tailored cryptocurrency pairs in regions around the world. In Nov. 2017, just as the cryptoeconomy’s last bull run was kicking into high gear, Nasdaq started working toward a bitcoin futures product for its Nasdaq Futures (NFX) exchange and had “briefed market participants on its plans,” per WSJ. Since then, the company has been mum on a release date for the offering. The crypto pivot suggested that the stock exchange operators, whose platform is currently bested in trade volume among all the world’s exchanges only by the New York Stock Exchange, thought it could make a superior offering compared to America’s inaugural bitcoin futures products greenlighted for CME Group and CBOE Global Markets Inc. in Dec. 2017. Likewise, in Dec. 2018, Nasdaq Ventures invested in the Series B fundraising round of ErisX, a forthcoming cryptocurrency derivatives platform that wants to take crypto contracts into the heart of Wall Street. It was an operational bet that the market for such derivatives has plenty of room to grow. Moreover, it was only last spring that Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq Inc., said the company’s leadership was open to the possibility of shifting into a cryptocurrency exchange in the future. “Certainly, Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time,” Friedman said. But it’s not all about just crypto for the company. Last summer, Nasdaq and a group of financial services enterprises collaborated with Dutch bank ABN AMRO on a blockchain-centric proof of concept designed to efficiently process margin calls in securities markets. “We believe that blockchain technology brings with it a huge potential to transform markets everywhere, and this project is an excellent showcase of this,” Nasdaq Clearing CEO Julia Haglind said of the project. Taken altogether, these various developments clearly indicate that Nasdaq’s wider forays into the cryptocurrency ecosystem may only be just beginning.",

        "passage": "Last week, the crypto market saw a historic event: both Bitcoin and Libra were mentioned in name by the sitting American President. Surprisingly enough, Donald Trump’s thoughts, or his administration’s thoughts rather, weren’t all optimistic. In a three-part Twitter thread that got picked up by just about every mainstream outlet, the businessman-turned-world leader was overtly bearish on Bitcoin, calling it volatile, inherently invaluable, and a medium for criminal financial activity.  As a result of this sudden tweetstorm, which many say would cement Bitcoin as “dangerous” in the eyes of millions, some investors began to run scared. The tweets, in fact, may be a way to explain Bitcoin’s move to $9,900. But, despite this, analysts and industry commentators are sure that in the long run, Trump’s tweet will only help to bolster the viability of the cryptocurrency industry. Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ resident cryptocurrency bull, Thomas Lee, made it clear that he’s unfazed by Trump’s impassioned roast of this budding industry. In the interview, Lee said that all things considered, the tweets are “positive” because they cement the idea that cryptocurrencies are a relevant topic on the global geopolitical and macroeconomic stage. Indeed, over the past few weeks, the words “Bitcoin”, “Libra”, and “Crypto” have begun to grace mainstream outlets and government hearings time and time again. That’s not all, as the markets analyst went on to suggest, Trump’s comments “makes the other 99% [of the world] more aware [of cryptocurrency].” And if 1% of this new audience somehow finds value in the cryptocurrency market, the size of the community surrounding this asset class would de-facto double instantly.  “It’s going to force everybody who is not involved — and remember a very small percentage actually cares about crypto and bitcoin — it’s going to force the other 98% of the world to think about what it means,” he added while in discussion with Yahoo’s anchors. That’s not all. As RT contributor Max Keiser explained, Trump’s anti-Bitcoin stance should force nations that are anti-Trump to look into cryptocurrencies to spite the American leader. In a world of ever-growing tension between nations on different sides of the political spectrum, this may not be as crazy as it sounds. Trump’s ability to boost the network effects of Bitcoin isn’t the only bullish sign in the eyes of Lee. From previous interviews and comments, it is clear that the Fundstrat co-founder has begun to identify a confluence of factors that could be a boon for BTC. These positive catalysts include the launch of Libra, which analyst Luke Martin suggested may be the biggest onramp to Bitcoin ever; a growth in cases of dovish fiscal policy, which some say will increase the chances of a recession and large inflationary events; and geopolitical tension that could only bolster the fundamental need for decentralized money. All this, Lee explains, could help Bitcoin in reaching the $20,000 to $40,000 range by the end of the year. He elaborates: A model from a prominent cryptocurrency fund manager, Timothy Peterson, also suggests that BTC hitting $40,000 is likely. Peterson recently noted that it’s possible to relate Bitcoin’s performance in the first half of any given year to the second half with a model. The model he derived suggests that since BTC rallied nearly 200% from January to the end of June, it has the potential of moving higher by around another 250% from year-to-date high levels.",

        "passage": "The hierarchy at Facebook is reportedly alive to the possibility that its flagship cryptocurrency project, Libra, may not get off the ground. Financial regulators and government authorities in multiple jurisdictions have expressed concerns over the possible launch of the digital currency. Some commentators say the social media giant should jettison its plans for a bespoke digital payment gateway in favor of acquiring a company like Square that has already had great success in obtaining relevant regulatory clearances.  Facebook has come out to issue a dire warning that the Libra project may not take off following the current state of the regulatory climate for cryptocurrency businesses. In its recently released quarterly report, the social media behemoth said it had plans to launch Libra in 2020 but such designs may not see the light of day. An excerpt from the company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reads: As previously reported by Blockonomi, there has been massive regulatory pushback against the Libra project since Facebook released the white paper. Almost everyone from members of the U.S. Congress to regulators in Europe, Asia, and Africa have expressed concerns over the project. Libra was even the subject of Congressional hearings as lawmakers sought to gain a better understanding of the industry. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and even the country’s President Donald Trump weighed in with negative comments about the project. Facebook for its part says it will the necessary steps to gain regulatory approval for Libra. The company highlighted the changing regulatory environment for the digital sphere which places more burden on tech companies to prove that their products do not pose systemic risks. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg even spoke about Facebook’s commitment to scaling all the regulatory hurdles saying: Meanwhile, some stakeholders in the U.S. believe that regulatory conditions in the country are net negative for America’s place in the emerging digital landscape. Critics of the patchwork of rules and guidelines say innovation is being driven away from the U.S. to other jurisdictions with fairer cryptocurrency and blockchain technology laws. Given the magnitude of the regulatory hurdles set before Facebook in launching Libra, some commentators say the company would do well to abandon the project and focus on other less controversial digital payment methods. Earlier in July, CNBC’s Jim Cramer advised the company to ditch Libra and instead acquire Jack Dorsey’s Square. Rather than trying to build a digital payment system, Cramer says Facebook should buy Square and expand the company’s operations. As previously reported by Blockonomi, Square recently launched bitcoin deposit integration on the platform. Dorsey for his part continues to be a staunch bitcoin proponent.",

        "passage": "During the 2018 bear market, the cryptoeconomy’s naysayers drummed many in the mainstream into thinking the bitcoin price was on a one-way track to becoming worthless. However, in light of the genesis cryptocurrency’s recent marked resurgence, optimism generally is rising as it seems clearer than ever that bitcoin’s best days are yet to come.  That optimism is being driven by several notable milestones being hit. For example, the bitcoin price just reached its best valuation so far in 2019, having crossed $11,000 USD over the weekend. That latest surge helped BTC achieve a 15-month price high, as the coin hadn’t traded over $11,000 since last spring. And that’s not all: the OG cryptocurrency has gained more than 160 percent in Q2 2019, making it the best quarter for “digital gold” since bitcoin jumped up 230 percent in Q4 2017, when the coin founded by Satoshi Nakamoto hit its all-time price high to date of $20,000. With a market capitalization over $195 billion at press time, bitcoin has indeed picked up steam after having entered this year’s second quarter just over the $4,000 mark. Of course, BTC’s best stretch ever remains Q1 2013, when the cryptocurrency spiked up by more than 600 percent. Yet that spike didn’t come after widespread calls of bitcoin’s doom in mainstream media circles. Indeed, the difference between then and today is that the current bitcoin run-up comes after many pundits said the cryptocurrency would never see a five-digit price point again. Now, bitcoin is only down 45 percent from its all-time price high. And the weekend surge means BTC is presently up 83 percent on the year and up 1,580 percent over the last five years. The upward movement comes as another blow to those who have likened bitcoin’s popularity to the popularity of tulips during Tulip Mania, a speculative bubble that reached a fever pitch before abruptly bursting in the 17th century Dutch Republic. Tulip prices never recovered during that “mania,” but the bitcoin price has recovered after 2018 and several times before that. Interest is flowing around Bitcoin once more, with Google searches for the cryptocurrency acutely on the rise. That’s no surprise, as social media powerhouse Facebook announced their Libra crypto last week, which brought considerable attention in kind to BTC, the cryptoeconomy’s reigning asset. The grand question for now, then: can the renewal of attention help power the bitcoin price to new heights? For his part, Trace Mayer, a long-time Bitcoiner, analyst, and maestro of the Bitcoin Knowledge podcast, thinks it’s possible that the bitcoin price eclipses its previous all-time high before the curtains close on 2019. Mayer noted as much during a June 24th tweet, in which he noted his “Mayer Multiple” model had the bitcoin price hitting $15,000 around September 2019 before reaching as high as $21,000 by year’s end. Mayer’s latest analysis also indicated BTC could cross over $30,000 next summer.  Of course, the future is ultimately inscrutable, so there’s no certainty that comes along with such predictions. Rather, Mayer — and other analysts like him — have used the available data to make their best bets. Yet with bitcoin putting up an impressive quarter and hitting its best valuation so far in 2019, the coin definitely has momentum going for it right now, and that momentum appears pointed upwards for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Mayer and similarly optimistic traders would be far from totally surprised to see BTC crack through $20,000 this year — especially not with Bitcoin’s fresh halvening set to take place next spring. That halvening will cut Bitcoin’s block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, and as such, the routine event is widely considered to  reinforce supply scarcity. Moreover, halvenings are also considered by some analysts to lead to acutely bullish price conditions.",

        "passage": "On May 15, the World Bank published a press release which stated that it had partnered with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) to enable blockchain-based secondary market bond recording. The secondary trading project was performed on the Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument (bond-i), a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. It was reportedly developed by CommBank’s Blockchain Centre of Excellence at the CommBank’s Innovation Lab in Sydney as part of the global banking institutions mission to explore and build on the potential of distributed ledgers.  Just last year, the World Bank issued the bond-i, claiming that it was created, allocated, and managed with the use of blockchain technology. At the time, CommBank was the sole arranger of the bond. It ended up making the World Bank a staggering AUD 110 million ($81 million), thanks to the contribution of investors such as financial services company Northern Trust Bank, the New South Wales (NSW) Treasury Corporation, and QBE Insurance Group Limited, Australia’s largest global insurer. The press release at the time, stated that the World Bank made $50 – $60 billion in yearly bond issuances every year in its bid to improve global market sustainability and mitigate poverty. The bond was further described as a milestone that would help put them in a much better position to advise countries on the risks and opportunities of disruptive technologies, especially concerning the institution’s Sustainable Development Goals. The World Bank sees the bond as the first step in the process of moving bond transactions from manual procedures to faster and quicker automated ones. Per the recent release, the World Bank declared that since bond-i was launched, both the project and the Bank have gotten support from numerous players within the global financial and technology sector. Sophie Gilder, Head of Experimentation & Commercialization, at the CommBank’s Innovation Labs, said, “There is a growing recognition that blockchain technology can deliver a superior digital market for raising capital and then managing and trading securities, so we are working with our strategic partners to realize that vision. Blockchain has the potential to streamline processes for raising capital and trading securities, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance regulatory oversight.” The World Bank does seem to be heavily invested in pursuing a deeper understanding of blockchain technology. Earlier this year, a report published on The Financial Times revealed that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had come together to launch a private blockchain network as a means of studying the technology and its potential. In addition to the private blockchain, both institutions were also alleged to have developed an asset, and while it wasn’t called a cryptocurrency, it sure looked and functioned like one. The report called the asset a “Learning Coin,” and claimed that it was based on their joint blockchain network. However, while it seemed like a cryptocurrency, the report maintained that it was fundamentally different. For one, the asset isn’t tied to any known fiat currency, and it doesn’t have any monetary value. It was reported to only be intended for use within the World Bank and the IMF as a tool for their staff to help uncover more about blockchain technology, with an emphasis placed on its underlying feature with digital assets. As such, the con and all its properties would only be accessible to World Bank and IMF staff. Both institutions were also said to have developed an app to help accompany the use of the Learning Coin. It was reported to be a research-assisting tool, which would help provide and develop learning apparatus like videos, research papers, and presentations.",

To this end, We want to help you “bookmark” the best resources possible. We’ll break it all down for you. We had to give ourselves a shoutout first! Sincerely, though, we’re well-placed here. Let us explain. Blockonomi caters toward educating our readers. The cryptocurrency space can be incredibly dense to newcomers and novices alike, but anyone can definitely get achieve the level of understanding they desire with a little daily catching up.  That’s where we at Blockonomi come in. We write guides and news features so readers can stay constantly up-to-date in the increasingly booming cryptocurrency craze. We carry guides on the basics, for the recurring waves of new investors: We cover more complicated subjects, too: And we cover important and timely crypto news headlines as well: We are currently hiring more writers and will make the move into the daily news space at some point in 2018 when we decide we will be able to maintain a good balance between educational posts and breaking news. So if you’re looking for a great starting point to dive into the crypto space, we’re ecstatic to help. Then there’s Bitcoin.com. By pure site visitors, Bitcoin.com appears to be the undisputed champion of crypto news sites, bringing in millions of viewers daily. The domain name certainly helps with that, but the page has been around for years and has always been good at scooping adoption and regulation stories for the community.  A few things to note: This site is ran by Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin evangelist who’s now one of the main community leaders behind the recently forked Bitcoin Cash (BCH). And, since the legacy Bitcoin and BCH communities have been trading PR blows and swipes on social media as of late, the two sides have become further polarized and entrenched, leading Ver to direct Bitcoin.com toward a not-so-subtle BCH bias in its news reporting. Now BCH is an interesting project, to be sure. The Bitcoin community in general will undoubtedly require both on-chain and off-chain solutions no matter how grumpy that makes either side, and Bitcoin Cash is angling after the “on-chain” of these solutions in a noteworthy way. Accordingly, it’s just worth pointing out that Bitcoin.com is a “BCH site,” as it were, when it comes down to it. But don’t let that stop you from checking out the headlines there. As mentioned previously, Bitcoin.com is always breaking global crypto news just as fast as anyone else in most cases. In the free market, everyone’s entitled to their opinions. It just helps to be aware of what those opinions are. Cointelegraph is a huge Bitcoin-centric news portal which covers breaking news and publishes a high volume of content each day. It employs a large team of writers and also is available to read in Spanish, Brazilian, Serbian and Japanese. Their news articles stand out by the fact they publish a custom illustration with each article they write so you will have noticed them on your Twitter feed quite regularly.  CCN.com just recently re-branded and changed domains from Cryptocoinsnews.com and is one of the larger news blogs about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. It started life back in 2013 and has grown to be a successful site serving over 100,000 unique visitors per day with good mix of news, reports and features. It is the partner site of Hacked.com which gives trading tips and delves more into ICOs and gives investment advice for a membership fee.  TheMerkle is another news blog which was founded in 2014 and offers a mix of informational posts, sponsored posts and breaking news pieces. It has a smaller team of 4 people who managed to post around 20 posts per day, which are typically shorter in length than other similar sites.  Bitcoinist despite the name focuses on most aspects of the Cryptocurrency world and publishes a good volume of content each day and has a large readership.  The standard of writing is high and they have some interesting information posts also. Their content tends to be shorter in length but they do cover most of the breaking stories so they’re a good one to add to your feed reader / Twitter account for up to date news.    Mainstream outlets haven’t been covering cryptocurrency that much until just recently. Two excellent mainstream sources that have been leading the pack, however, are CNBC and Forbes. Indeed, these outlets are pumping out crypto-based content out as of late, showing that they’re turning their attention to the space in a decisive way. And in this light, they bring the reputational journalistic integrity to the ecosystem in way that only large media firms can bring. The content has a super-polished touch, which is always nice. Check out this recent CNBC interview of macrotrader Mike Novogratz, for example:  Reddit is where users come together on “subs” to share news, have conversations, engage in debates. All that good stuff. On Reddit, then, you have very decentralized and compartmentalized communities that constantly circulate breaking news. So, say, if the Ripple (XRP) price is surging, you can go to /r/Ripple see a slew of headlines posted by users that might explain, or partially explain, the said bull run. Now multiply that scenario across every cryptocurrency project and its associated subreddit, and you’ve got a ton of fantastic news and tools at your fingertips. Just like we mentioned with Bitcoin.com earlier, though, you’ll need to understand that each subreddit is naturally biased in favor of their own project. So /r/ethtrader users aren’t big fans of Litecoin. The /r/Bitcoin and the pro-BCH /r/btc communities hate each other. You know, the typical tribalism you seen in any field of human interest. So just read around to get a fuller picture; don’t take the views expressed on a single subreddit as the end-all-be-all. So of the more heavyweight subreddits include: When it comes to YouTube, there’s two fellows you should definitely follow: Boxmining and Ivan on Tech. Both of these channels are excellent, informative, unbiased, and regularly productive (in the content sense). Boxmining, also known by his name real name Michael, covers cryptocurrency news, reviews, and price analyses everyday. And his insider connections in China give him unparalleled insight into the regulatory atmosphere there. Ivan on Tech, or Ivan, is a programmer by day, so he uses his programming knowledge to help explain the cryptocurrency ecosystem in a way that’s easily understandable and extremely insightful. Subscribe to their channels, and you won’t be disappointed. And even cooler? The two pundits do livestreams together periodically. Check out this brand new one they just hosted. The cryptocurrency arena is extremely news-driven at present. Until boatloads of institutional money stabilizes these coin prices, a bad or good story can send prices shooting up or down. At the fact of the matter is that many Twitter accounts are “creating” news right now. For example, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently hailed OmiseGo (OMG) as his favorite kind of token model on Twitter. That tweet alone sent the OMG price skyrocketing acutely. There’s a lot of great personalities on the platform to follow. From citizen sleuths, to trolls who ask the right questions, to industry insiders that post routinely, you should definitely use Twitter as a pseudo-source for news (upon which you can do further research).",

        "passage": "The first Binance stablecoin is coming, and the token just got a clean bill of health from smart contract security startup Quantstamp. On July 18th, the Y Combinator-backed auditors announced they had finished reviewing the code of the pound sterling stablecoin, dubbed Binance GBP (BGBP) by the powerhouse Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange.  As part of the audit, Quantstamp’s experts checked the token’s code against the ERC20 token standard and combed for security flaws and any other problematic issues. The team’s work led to Binance updating their ERC20 libraries through OpenZeppelin and removing other miscellaneous “low risk issues.” Binance, nimble navigators of global regulatory arbitrage, are pushing ahead on the stablecoin against the almost poetic backdrop of Facebook blockchain head David Marcus having faced calls for a Libra development moratorium in U.S. congressional oversight hearings this week. Of course, BGBP will simply be pegged 1:1 with the pound, whereas Libra is being more ambitiously devised like a Big Tech-backed non-sovereign central bank currency. (Note: Binance has considered attempting to join the Libra Association, per company chief strategy officer Gin Chao). The BGBP won’t be too simple though, as the token is set to be released both on Ethereum and the exchange’s in-house blockchcain, Binance Chain, Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao said on the news: The stablecoin comes after CEO Zhao confirmed during a YouTube “Ask Me Anything” back in May that the exchange was exploring launching its own stablecoins. Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma hailed the BGBP audit as just the latest sign of the startup’s rising prominence in the cryptoeconomy: In recent months, the fledgling play has made a name for itself in reviewing the smart contracts of high-profile industry stakeholders like eToro and Prysmatic Labs, and in doing so has “secured over a billion dollars of digital asset value,” the company has said. In June, the startup launched the Quantstamp Security Network V2 on the Ethereum mainnet. With the activation, users can leverage the network scan and store smart contract vulnerability reports on the Ethereum blockchain. The update also made it possible for community members to run a Quantstamp node to earn the network’s native token, QSP. The Malta-based exchange is taking a blitzkrieg approach to asserting itself as the cryptoeconomy’s leading service provider. This month alone, Binance has burned $24 million worth of its BNB tokens, opened up a margin trading platform, announced plans for a cryptocurrency futures service, and turned two years old. On the margin trading launch, CEO Zhao noted the company was gunning to become the most useful exchange brand for cryptocurrency users of all stripes: Notably, the exchange also recently confirmed that it was looking to open up a new America-based operation, Binance US.",

        "passage": "The institution saddled with the responsibility of supplying the United Kingdom’s coinage, Royal Mint Limited has ditched plans to launch a gold-backed cryptocurrency as a result of the government’s decision to veto the project, according to a Reuters report. The project has been in the pipeline since 2016 as the Royal Mint had contemplated issuing “Royal Mint Gold” (RMG) tokens, worth as much as $1 billion backed by gold assets in the Mint’s vaults. American based commodity derivative exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was to serve as the blockchain platform on which RMG would be traded.  The digital gold currency was meant to be backed by gold reserves and at the time, it was expected to change the way “traders and investors trade, execute and settle gold,” according to its press release. Observers anticipated the rollout of RMG before the end of 2017 following an official collaboration between CME Group and the Royal Mint to develop the bullion product.  CME posted on its website, at the time, that it was working with blockchain security company BitGo to come up with a “fast, cost-effective and cryptographically secure method” of purchasing, retaining and transacting the precious mineral. Financial institutions opened their systems to the RMG trading platform as they expected its formal operation by the end of the year. The Royal Mint also made known on its website that the tokens would serve as an alternative way to invest in trade and physical gold. It aims to provide the investment performance of the London Gold Market with the transparency of an exchange-traded asset.  The launch was postponed till 2018, but things went awry following the indifference of CME to make the project a reality.  “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved;” an anonymous source from Royal Mint disclosed in the report. The sudden display of apathy from CME was allegedly owing to the shift in priorities away from digital assets – a policy change caused by the retirements of CEO Phupinder Gill and head of digitization Sandra Ro in 2018.  Thus, enthusiasm towards digital assets gradually waned. In 2017, CME joined the league of companies that launched bitcoin futures trading on their respective platforms. This includes a number of other digital asset startups which the company has invested in. Amidst the sluggish trading activity during the third trade quarter of 2017, the firm reported $904.2 million worth of revenue – a stark contrast to $890.8 million reported in the same period of 2016. The company’s new Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy attributed the growth to the company’s strength in interest rate, equities, and metal product lines. Contrary to the position of Royal Mint on the botched deal, CME denied any form of negligence on its path. “It is not correct to say we have de-emphasized’ digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy,” a source said. Consequent upon the exit of CME, Royal Mint made efforts to bring the project back to light by entering into a partnership with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The plans were, however, scuttled by the finance ministry of the United Kingdom.  All hopes might, however, not be lost yet as the Royal Mint looks forward to giving it a shot in the nearest future. “We will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” a source disclosed to the agency.",

        "passage": "Cambridge Associates, a pensions and endowments adviser says more institutional investors should invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Analysts at the Boston-based advisory firm the emerging asset class has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in the established digital world. Thus, big-money players stand the chance of gaining first-mover advantage by claiming significant positions on virtual currency investments.  According to Bloomberg, the firm issued a note to its clients on Monday (February 18, 20190 urging them to consider Bitcoin investment funds. Analysts at Cambridge Associates say crypto-focused investments could potentially reap huge rewards for institutional investors. The company says the risks associated with Bitcoin and other virtual currencies shouldn’t dissuade big-money players from putting up equity in the market. Throughout 2018, cryptocurrencies endured a prolonged bear market that caused prices to plummet by more than 80 percent. Commenting on the matter in the note to clients, Cambridge Associates analysts said: However, while cryptocurrency investments have the potential to produce massive returns, the firm says institutional investors shouldn’t jump in head first without carrying out due diligence. According to the analysts, pension funds, endowments, family offices, and other big-money players should obtain adequate information about the industry before deciding on which investments to make. While still in its infancy, the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, spawning different investment avenues. From spot trading on exchange platforms to futures contracts and even illiquid venture funds, there are numerous options for institutional investors. Already, some institutions have invested significantly in cryptocurrencies. In February 2019, Morgan Creek Digital announced that it had secured investments from two public pension funds based in Fairfax County, Virginia. These two funds are the first public pension plans to invest in cryptocurrencies. On Monday, Blockonomi reported that big-money investors make up the majority of the revenue inflow for Grayscale Investments, a virtual currency asset management firm. According to the company’s annual report, institutional investors contributed 66 percent of its inflows for the entire 2018. Stakeholders like Tom Lee say 2019 could be a watershed year for the emerging cryptocurrency landscape as a whole. These commentators say while there might not be a massive price rally, different projects are laying the groundwork for the establishment of the market on a more robust footing. However, if the wave of institutional investors that continues to be the clamor for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts is ever going to materialize, many commentators say the industry needs improved legitimacy. Thus, issues like price manipulation, ICO scams, and other fraudulent activities need to be eradicated or at least minimized. Robust custody tools and market manipulation continue to be prominent pain points for the market as a whole. In January, Fidelity Investments announced that it would launch its cryptocurrency custodial service in March 2019. Nasdaq also recently announced a partnership with Brave New Coin (BNC) to offer real-time price indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In a recent interview with Forbes, Alex Sunnarborg, managing partner at Tetras Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund management firm, says the launch of services like Fidelity and Bakkt will be pivotal to the status of the industry as a whole. The entry of such reputable mainstream players could introduce sweeping changes in the legitimacy of virtual currency market data.",

        "passage": "Argentina’s Alto Viaje just teamed up with Bitex to allow the use of Bitcoin on the nation’s SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico) payment platform. SUBE is a card-based system that can be used on numerous modes of transportation across Argentina, including subways, buses, and trains. Last week Cointelegraph in Spanish reported that Alto Viaje, which is a third-party platform, expanded its payment methods to accept Bitcoin with the help of Bitex. It previously accepted PayPal, as well as Rapipago, which is a payment system native to Argentina. The recently announced program will allow more than seven million people who currently use the SUBE system to pay with BTC. Manuel Beaudroit, who is the CMO at Bitex, commented that his company was happy to work with Alta Viaje to expand the use of Bitcoin.  Unlike many countries, Argentina has been willing to let crypto-based businesses and payment platforms grow. In addition to being home to one of the first banks that used BTC to circumvent the SWIFT system, Argentina is home to a growing number of BTC ATMs. Banco Masventas made headlines last year when it worked with Bitex to transfer money out of Argentina with BTC, a move the bank claimed was much faster and cheaper than using the aging SWIFT system. Argentina has dealt with numerous banking restrictions over the last 20 years, which may be part of the reason why the nation is happy to let the crypto economy take root. Unlike fiat currency, cryptos can be used to transfer money on a peer-to-peer basis. Cryptos have a major advantage in a geopolitical environment that is growing more complex. Argentinians have dealt with major financial problems since at least the 1970s, and many lost access to their money during the crisis that started in 1999. Today people in Argentina can hold a variety of cryptos, which will be at their disposal no matter what happens to the banking system in their country. Not only do cryptos ensure that people have something they can trade with, but they also guarantee that the economy will continue to function. Centralized control over the banking and monetary system is generally accepted by people who live in countries like the United States, probably because they have never lived through a real financial crisis. It should come as no surprise that cryptos are catching on in Latin America, which has a long history of economic upheaval. Abstract terms used by economists serve to obfuscate the real engine of economic functionality; the people who work to produce useful goods and services. When a banking system collapses, people can’t trade easily. Centralized control over money and markets has a dark side, which few in the developed world are familiar with. Cryptos are a new way for people to connect with each other. Digital money doesn’t need to be stored in banks, nor do banks need to be involved in the settlement process. If the Argentine banking system collapses (again), the people there could still pay for transportation using BTC. The banks don’t matter with cryptos, which is why digital peer-to-peer platforms are such a radical change from the existing financial system. Cryptos could be even more important for larger financial institutions and corporations, in the event of a global banking crisis. At the end of the day, a corporation has to maximize shareholder value, regardless of what kind of money they use for trade settlement. Bitcoin might not be the perfect crypto to replace the global financial system, but it does have some amazing advantages over fiat money and centralized banking. As the century unfolds, we might see more people turning to cryptos as a currency of last resort.",

        "passage": "Members and colleagues of SmartContract, the team behind the Chainlink decentralized oracle project, unveiled research this week on a new privacy boosting DeFi tool dubbed Mixicles. In a paper released by SmartContract researchers Sergey Nazarov, Alex Coventry, Steve Ellis, Brendan Magauran, and technical advisors Ari Juels and Lorenz Breidenbach, Mixicles rely on oracles to “report” on payouts of inputted payments rather than randomized shuffling as traditional cryptocurrency mixers do.  “Mixicles are designed for the purpose of preserving privacy for financial instruments, not the concealment of cryptocurrency movements,” the authors explained. In other words, a Mixicle as outlined would be ideal for enterprises that want to have operational auditability while also having the privacy of its blockchain operations ensured. To this end, the researchers noted: That’s where Mixicles aim for: toward privacy and regulatory compliance. Moreover, Mixicles are also interesting for “their avoidance of expensive cryptography and complicated contract structures,” meaning they can run efficiently without being resource intensive. Notably, this new DeFi privacy tool hasn’t only been designed with efficiency in privacy in mind — it’s also been specifically structured to be compatible with the Chainlink decentralized oracle network. Yet Mixicles are only a proposed piece of a wider privacy approach, as the instruments have their limitations. For one, Mixicles don’t provide privacy for an input address’s prior activities or for an output address’s later activities. Also, Mixicles can allow users to report “oracle malfeasance” but not to prevent such malfeasance from occurring in the first place. Even still, if the technology takes off it will likely become a welcomed addition to the blockchain ecosystem’s growing privacy options. For example, the tech’s researchers have described it as relatively agnostic implementation-wise and capable of being integrated with complementary solutions, like the Zether privacy protocol for Ethereum (of which JP Morgan has developed its own version, Anonymous Zether). Whatever happens, the authors noted there is more work to be done: As decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have made a comeback in the Ethereum community in 2019, a growing topic of discussion has been how to protect the privacy of DAO members during organizational votes and beyond. A new potential option? Sempahore, a “zero-knowledge signalling gadget” designed by a trio of developers to allow Ethereum users to confidentially interact with arbitrary strings of data. Such a system would provide DAO users the privacy they have been calling for lately, though Semaphore’s possibilities go beyond just signalling. “In the near future, it can be used for other privacy-enhancing applications such as anonymous login, anonymous DAOs, anonymous voting, and journalism,” Ethereum developer Koh Wei Jie explained of the project on September 2nd.  Thus the “gadget” is yet another domino to drop in the Ethereum community’s race toward privacy optimizations — a race that’s recently been heating up. For instance, the coming Istanbul upgrade for Ethereum contains some optimizations that will make it more affordable to make encrypted transactions on the platform.",

        "passage": "The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the nonprofit with dozens of high-profile members focused on helping businesses use Ethereum, is launching a new initiative to make its namesake public blockchain “work for all.” To do that and help further the EEA’s roadmap in general, the organization announced on August 6th it had appointed Aya Miyaguchi, the Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation since early 2018, as the latest member of the alliance’s Board of Directors.  On the news, Miyaguchi hailed the appointment as another domino dropping in the Ethereum Foundation’s efforts to bridge the divide between Ethereum can do and how enterprises can leverage the smart contract platform’s infrastructure.  “As blockchain adoption accelerates, it’s important that the Ethereum Foundation work to connect businesses with the latest research and development coming from our worldwide community, and that we convey our challenges and experiences while better understanding those impacting industries,” she said. As for the aforementioned new campaign, the EEA has dubbed it the Mainnet Initiative. The effort will lead to the formation of a working group that will serve as a hub for alliance members collaborating on public chain Ethereum tech. The idea is that the effort will make Ethereum “like the internet” by working toward “public network components [matching] the commercial market requirements needed to allow the world to connect to Ethereum.” Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum and Board member at the EEA, characterized the coordination campaign as coming right on time, insofar as major companies have been increasingly experimenting with building on and through the smart contract platform: Some of those large organizations include Microsoft, EY, JP Morgan, and Google Cloud. In just this year alone, Microsoft has created a verification tool for Solidity, EY and JP Morgan have respectively worked on Ethereum privacy tools, and the Google Cloud team has posited how to create hybrid “blockchain cloud” apps using Google’s BigQuery, Ethereum, and the decentralized oracle middleware tech of Chainlink. In their Tuesday announcement, the EEA said more would be revealed about the Mainnet Initative at the upcoming Devcon 5 conference set to take place from October 8th through the 11th in Osaka, Japan. Notably, the Ethereum development conference’s second round of tickets went on sale on Tuesday and sold out in short order.  Tickets were purchasable in ether (ETH), leading to the latest light gust in the Ethereum community’s meme debate as to whether ether is, in fact, money. On the one hand are those like Vlad Zamfir who have argued ETH isn’t money because “there is no monetary policy” backing it. On the flip side, others like EthHub co-creator Eric Conner have asserted if ETH can be used like money, it’s money.  Zooming out, this year’s Devcon should make for a busy one, particularly if the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract is launched there. Earlier this summer, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake noted the possibility could play out. “One of the reasons to have this very public ceremony is so that we can all agree on the exact address of the deposit contract and avoid scam deposit contracts,” he said.",

        "passage": "Yesterday, a computer and television were stolen by a team of three suspects in Saratoga, California. The three were allegedly acting as movers and helping a family to load their items into and off of a moving truck. According to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office, the three movers met the family through “a mutual acquaintance”. Things didn’t turn out so well, however, as the suspects demanded money, and paid themselves by taking a computer loaded with bitcoin. A type of scam that has been unfortunately growing is what’s known in some circles as a movers ransom. Basically speaking, a bogus moving company or independent movers will get all of a clients items loaded onto a truck. At this point, they may drive a short distance or even all the way to the destination. Then, the swindle begins. The scammers will typically start to demand additional compensation. If the compensation is not given, scammers will threaten to take things, break objects, or simply drive the truck away with everything inside. Since the victim is in a very weak position as all of their belongings are locked away in a truck, many of them will comply and pay extra money. In the Saratoga case, the Sheriff’s office said: Unbeknownst to the thieving group, the stolen computer apparently was loaded with a bitcoin wallet that held around $10,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. What’s interesting about this is that cases like this could end up setting an important precedent for the future. In most countries, if someone is caught stealing property, the degree of punishment given is often related to the value of goods stolen. For example, stealing a bicycle is often considered a lesser crime than stealing a Ferrari.  The Suspects, Image from Apacnewswire In the US, a minor theft is known as petty larceny. A major theft, on the other hand, is known as grand larceny, and comes with serious jail time and a permanent felony record that will follow the perpetrator for life. The law is also not explicitly clear on a dollar amount that would equal petty versus grand larceny. But what happens if someone steals an old laptop worth say one hundred dollars, but that laptop contained one million dollars in cryptocurrency? Would the thief who stole the laptop, not knowing what was on it, be subject to punishment equivalent to stealing $1 million worth of property? To make things even more complicated, what if the thief stole a device that had keys to an altcoin stash that was nearly worthless, but then later pumped up in value massively after the perpetrator was already arrested? And what point would the value apply to the punishment, if at all? This goes without saying, but anyone who stores cryptocurrency needs to have a way to recover access to it in the event of a stolen device. In the case of the Saratoga theft, if the owner of the computer kept a backup of their private keys, then in the worst case they would only be out the computer and not the bitcoin. We’ve done reviews in the past on some interesting products that can help secure a 12 or 24-words seed phrase such as the Billfodl. An item like that could have prevented any major crypto loss due to physical theft of a device.  Sheriff Laurie Smith also noted that “The public should take the necessary steps to safeguard their virtual property because it is vulnerable like physical property”. With that sage advice in mind, we recommend again not only to protect the devices that you use your wallet on, but also the private keys and seed phrases that access your funds so that you can always recover them to a new device.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin (BTC) has had a crazy seven weeks. After feigning death for upwards of three months, with there being little price action and scant volumes to speak of, the cryptocurrency market returned. In fact, as of the time of writing this, the 24-hour volume figure on Bitwise’s BitcoinTradeVolume indicator reads at $917 million, much higher than the $500 million seen prior to all this price action. (Just last week, this read at a jaw-dropping $2.38 billion).  As cryptocurrency interest in spot markets, often dominated by retail investors, has surged, derivatives platforms have seen massive upticks too. While many see this as a sign that the “crypto winter” has ended, some are worried that derivatives could hamper Bitcoin’s long-term success and underlying value proposition. Last week, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures contract saw its biggest day, well, ever. According to exact data compiled by the CME itself, 33,677 contracts were traded on May the 13th, amounting to 168,385 paper BTC. This is absolutely staggering, especially considering that the last record, set in February, was a relatively mere 91,690 BTC. While volume died down after that trading session, data shows that money on derivatives platforms is still flooding in and out of the cryptocurrency market. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency publication Diar released its latest newsletter. In the edition, it was revealed that Bitcoin derivatives volumes have grown alongside volumes seen on spot markets. Citing data from analytics startup Skew, Diar notes that on platforms like CME, Deribit, BitMEX, and the Kraken-owned CryptoFacilities, Bitcoin vehicle volumes are reaching multi-month, even all-time highs.  Indeed, according to a CME-stamped email from The Block, “May is shaping up to be the strongest month ever for CME Bitcoin Futures.” The Chicago-based market looked to the fact that on May 13th, $1.3 billion worth of paper BTC changed hands, and the number of accounts trading the product has grown well above 2,500. The exchange explains this statistic: It’s a similar sight on the more cryptocurrency-specific platforms. In May (so far), BitMEX has seen $78.6 billion worth of volume, around half of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, while Deribit has seen nearly $600 million worth of volume for its array of options contracts. Although many see a growing derivatives ecosystem is a sign of a maturing market, some have postulated that for BTC and other cryptocurrencies, this could be detrimental in the long term. Wall Street banker turned blockchain advocate Caitlin Long wrote last year that the financialization of cryptocurrency might be a “double-edged sword”. She wrote that cryptocurrencies are inherently equity-based, meaning that they are nothing like stocks, bonds, and its ilk. This makes futures markets, especially those that allow for margin/leverage, for this new asset class somewhat controversial in that they allow for the “issuance of more assets out of thin air to dilute existing holders, or from the creation of more claims to the asset than there are assets.” With Bitcoin’s premise being one of scarcity and one of “holding one’s own keys”, the introduction of institutionally-centric leverage futures markets could artificially dilute the cryptocurrency’s market, despite the fact that there aren’t coins to back those vehicles. Even if this isn’t true, futures, especially those that are margin-enabled, have been proven to cause inorganic price discovery in the cryptocurrency market. Researcher Willy Woo recently noted that Bitcoin’s recent foray past $8,000 was most likely a result of “pros” trading and playing this nascent market to their advantage. He accentuates that blockchain data, which should show money flowing from “HODLers” to exchanges and exchanges to exchanges in rallies, showed minimal capital movement. Woo thus confirms that much of the recent rally was an “orchestrated short squeeze to milk profits”, likely done through the medium of a non-KYC, easily-accessible, high-volume derivatives platforms like BitMEX.",

        "passage": "Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has finally begun to falter. After weeks of non-stop bullish price action, which resulted in cryptocurrencies gaining 100% in two months’ time, buyers have begun to relent. And as a result, BTC has fallen to $7,650 — around 20% lower than it was at its local peak, $9,100. In spite of this, many analysts are still overwhelmingly bullish, drawing attention to the fact that strong fundamental developments should drive demand for cryptocurrency.  In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has lost approximately 3%. While some say that this is a bearish sign, there remain optimists. In a recent Forbes article, Naeem Aslam of Think Markets U.K. doubled down on his prediction that BTC may soon skyrocket past $10,000. Aslam, who once called for Bitcoin to eventually reach a valuation in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, explained that June has historically been a good month for cryptocurrency. Citing data he gathered, the analyst noted that the five-year trailing high growth for BTC in June is 25.98%, implying that “the price of Bitcoin can rise up to $10,712.” That’s all well and good, but what will drive demand? According to Aslam, the impending launch of Facebook’s digital asset will. For those unaware, the social media heavyweight is expected to release the white paper for its cryptocurrency, dubbed “Globalcoin” or “Libra”, on June 18th. Although the actual launch of the asset is not slated to arrive until late-2019 or early-2020, many are sure that this move alone will validate Bitcoin and digital assets on the global stage. Globalcoin is expected to be a stablecoin backed by an array of fiat currencies that can be used in Facebook’s ecosystem as a digital medium of exchange. Aslam writes that the white paper will be a “catalyst” for Bitcoin’s price to move higher. He is far from the only one to think so. Analyst and industry commentator Luke Martin recently explained that for much of crypto’s history, entrants to the industry started with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is, of course, the “largest, most well-known, first decentralized cryptocurrency” that acts as an on-ramp to any other cryptocurrency ecosystem. But with Facebook in the fold, Martin suggests that Globalcoin may usurp Bitcoin’s status as the cryptocurrency onramp. This isn’t postulation, as it is expected for Globalcoin to be easily purchased/gained through physical automated tellers, regulated exchanges, and purportedly a rewards system for Facebook users. And from there, Globalcoin adopters will be eased into the broader cryptocurrency space.  What do the numbers look like? You may be asking. Well, according to Ari Paul of BlockTower Capital, even a conservative estimate of Facebook’s impact on the cryptocurrency space is already looking amazing. In a Twitter thread published earlier this year, Paul explained that if 300 million of Facebook’s two billion users were to adopt the corporate cryptocurrency, 10% of this 300 million could “stumble across” Bitcoin. This would “double the number of Bitcoin users, increasing the pace of adoption, the network effects, and the value of the network.” No price target can be extrapolated from these numbers, but such an inflow would likely result in the biggest influx of buying pressure this space has ever seen. So back to the $10,000 target. As reported by Blockonomi previously, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee believes that once BTC hits five figures, all hell will break loose for the cryptocurrency market. As Lee wrote on Twitter earlier this month, “[$10,000] will see FOMO from those who gloated about the 90% crash in BTC… and those who saw Bitcoin dead as forever.” He went as far to say in a recent podcast with Binance’s chief financial officer that once the aforementioned level is breached, BTC will be clear to shoot to $20,000 and $40,000 within a few months’ time.",

        "passage": "Coinbase has just announced that they have officially begun their cryptocurrency custody service. While the program is still in its early phase, they already have their first client and have accepted their first deposit. Custody services are a way for large financial organizations to securely deposit their assets in a way that is insured. This service, the first of its kind, could lead to larger institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies at large.  Featured Image: The Coinbase Blog  Custody isn’t something that we usually think about every day, but it is something that affects nearly all of our lives. Basically speaking, custody is where you deposit your assets or valuables (such as dollars or gold) so that they cannot be easily stolen from you. For instance, keeping money in the bank protects you from physical theft, fire, flood, and other forms of loss. As well, deposits made in a bank or with a custodian are typically insured. When it comes to cryptocurrency, however, a number of different considerations need to be made. While individuals can hold cryptocurrency in a very secure way that is resistant to the previously mentioned vulnerabilities such as physical theft, cryptocurrencies can still be lost or stolen. This is especially true if one is not an expert in cryptocurrency security.  Read Also: Ledger vs Trezor Review What’s also important is to consider the unique challenges faced by institutional investors that could have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies that they need to securely store for long periods of time. For an individual, something like a hardware wallet or other form of cold storage could be sufficient. But if hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin were to disappear due to a successful hack, serious problems could arise. The advantage of using a custody service is threefold. First, a custody service should have significant infrastructure and the technological experience needed to know how to protect assets. For instance, if you store money in the vault at a bank, it is much more secure than simply putting it in your pocket, or underneath your mattress. That’s because as individuals, we are not security experts and cannot afford to invest in a high-grade vault or fleet of armored cars. When it comes to custody, they can afford to implement these kinds of infrastructure investments. In the case of Coinbase, they have so far never lost assets due to a hack. The second major benefit is that a custodian, upon accepting deposits, becomes liable for their care. This means that in the event of a hack or theft, the institution who made the deposit is not personally liable for this loss. Think of it this way. If you keep your bitcoin on an exchange – which is not a custodial service, and that exchange is hacked, generally speaking your bitcoin is gone forever. If you have a custodial arrangement, on the other hand, then the custodian would be liable for and required to replace any assets that they were responsible for losing. The final and perhaps most significant advantage of using a custodian is that custodians are insured. In the event that a loss occurs, the custodian can fall back on their own insurance that will then be responsible for making certain that all depositors will be credited. Many cryptocurrency commentators like John McAfee have stated on multiple occasions that once institutional investors like banks and hedge funds become invested in cryptocurrency, then the valuation and stability of crypto assets will both improve.  Today, the global cryptocurrency markets combined are only equal to less than half of one trillion dollars. While this may seem like a lot of money, in terms of global finance it is actually quite small. Now that institutional money has a way to safely and securely enter the cryptocurrency market, we may see a general upward trend over time. Coinbase will not be providing these services for free of course. According to their announcement that was linked to on Twitter, the fees for using this service are considerable. In order to use the service, there is a $100,000 setup fee for each account, and each account must maintain a minimum balance of $10 million. On top of that, Coinbase is levying a monthly fee of 10 basis points per month. This is equivalent to 0.001% per month. This would be mean a fee of $100 per month on a $10 million deposit. The announcement did not specify if this fee would be charged based on the valuation of the assets, or would be charged as a percentage of the cryptocurrency itself. The company does note as well that these rates could change as adoption rates change over time.",

        "passage": "It is impossible to say how increased use of cryptos will influence the price. The rocket ride that cryptos experienced in 2017 wasn’t backed by a massive increase in usage, but now it looks like crypto adoption is on a steady climb higher. According to a recent report from statistics aggregator Coin ATM Radar, the number of crypto ATMs just shot past 4,000 globally. Instead of following crypto prices down over the course of 2018, the number of crypto ATMs is actually rising. In fact, according to the report, there are almost 5 cryptos ATMs being added to the global fleet on a monthly basis.  It is even more impressive that the stock of crypto ATMs is rising despite their legal status in nations like India. The vast majority of crypto ATMs are in North America. Coin ATM Radar says that 71.8% of crypto ATMs are in North America, with 56% in the United States and 15% in Canada. Europe has 23% of the world’s crypto ATMs, and Asia has just and 2.6%. Oceania, South America and Africa all have a few crypto ATMs, but aren’t seeing the adoption rates that are happening in more developed areas of the world. It is worth remembering that in two of the world’s most populous nations, China and India, cryptos are basically illegal.  Read: Guide to Bitcoin ATMs: A Brief Primer on Buying BTC On the Go The developers of India’s first crypto ATM were arrested last November in Bangalore for criminal charges relating to the ‘ATM’ label that was applied to their machine. The developers of the machine claim that their product wasn’t strictly an ATM, but apparently, it was close enough to get caught up in the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) crackdown on anything crypto last year. On the face of it this kind of treatment would seem negative for cryptos. In the short-term, it will keep a nation of more than a billion people from using cryptos freely, but it could lead to a surge in crypto adoption later on. Many of India’s citizens are ‘unbanked’ and could benefit from the accessibility to financial services that cryptos create. India has struggled with both corruption and tax evasion. Because most Indians can’t afford to use banks, they are locked into a cash economy which presents some major disadvantages. Cryptos could resolve these problems, but it looks like the Indian government and RBI aren’t willing to allow crypto entrepreneurs the freedom to innovate. Ripple may be the best example of a crypto company that has been able to bridge the gap between the established financial system, and the up-and-coming crypto universe. Ripple announced last week that 13 new companies had signed up to use their RippleNet payment network, which brings the total number of companies on RippleNet to over 200. The company said that JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank will be using XRP cross-border payments, instead of going through traditional channels. XRP transfers are almost instant, which eliminates the FOREX risk which is associated with the SWIFT system. It also saves companies days of waiting for their funds, as the banks use an archaic system that emerged around the same time as the modem. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote that, The real loser in all this will probably be the international banking system, and especially the SWIFT system. While SWIFT has been working on a blockchain-based transfer platform, they are unlikely to be able to compete with companies like Ripple, who is years ahead of anyone else, and has already cemented relationships with industry groups like the R3 consortium.",

        "passage": "While markets remain depressed, over recent weeks, trading activity in the crypto world has seen an unexpected uptick. Volumes registered on sites like CoinMarketCap have surged, especially on Bitcoin trading pairs, leading some to consider the possibility that a bullish reversal is on the horizon. But, Bitwise Asset Management, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency-focused investment services firm, dropped a bombshell last week. The company claimed that 95% of all BTC trading activity is decidedly false.  For those who missed the memo, on Friday, Bitwise unveiled a report titled “The Real Bitcoin Market.” While its title sounds innocuous enough, this wasn’t exactly the case. The firm’s researchers remark that while some expect for Bitcoin markets to be “uniquely orderly and efficient, with tight spreads and nearly perfect arbitrage,” this is far from the case. Over a series of slides, Bitwise reveals that this explains that this budding ecosystem is often disjointed, with there being great discrepancies in exchange prices. And this is purportedly for good reason. As explained earlier, volume readings posted on “data aggregators” could be 95% false “and/or non-economic in nature.”  To back this foreboding fact, Bitwise draws attention to “suspicious exchanges” such as the little-known CoinBene, which actively claims to have supported hundreds in millions worth of BTC trades each and every day. CoinBene purportedly utilizes “trade printing” between the bid and ask prices, hinting that there could be a bot behind much of the trades. In another case, a platform known as RightBTC had a number of periods, which extended to “multiple hours and days,” that had zero volume, even though it claims to have “roughly 4x the volume of Coinbase Pro.” Lastly, it calls on CHAOEX, which sported trading periods that looked extremely “monotonic.” As data providers give exchanges a platform often without question, many pointed fingers at CoinMarketCap following the release of the report. While the company was quiet about the subject matter for four days, a company representative issued a statement to Bloomberg. Per the report, Carylyne Chan, CoinMarketCap’s global head of marketing, wrote to the outlet that these fears about false volumes “are valid.” As such, Chan explained that the firm will be adding more tools, namely liquidity gauges, exchange wallet balances, and traffic figures, to give the site’s millions of daily users (the site is a top-500 webpage) a better way to determine the actual standing of this budding market. She explains: While Bitwise’s report likely irked many a crypto investor, some have made the surprising argument that, somehow, there are silver linings in this case. In a recent CoinTelegraph Youtube segment, Mati Greenspan of eToro claimed that the discrediting of false volumes show that Bitcoin markets are surprisingly efficient. In a podcast interview conducted by industry content creator Peter McCormack, Bitwise’s head of research, Matt Hougan, expressed a similar sentiment. He explains that when you boil the cryptocurrency market down to its bonafide roots, it makes a lot more sense. In fact, Hougan explains that if you are to only take legitimate trading activity into account, Bitcoin’s market looks a lot more like that of gold and other commodities. And this, of course, could set a positive precedent for Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF application, which is currently being looked over by the SEC.",

        "passage": "The Bitcoin (BTC) bull run has barely even started, but Fundstrat Global Advisors is absolutely euphoric. In a graphic published recently, the investment advisory firm suggested that the “Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)” is quickly materializing in the cryptocurrency markets, boding well for BTC’s performance in the short to medium term.  Fundstrat, especially its co-founder Thomas Lee, have kept an eye on the cryptocurrency space for years now. In a recent research note, which was reposted by Financial Times’ Adam Samson, the New York firm suggested that the Bitcoin market is currently in a euphoric state, marked by a “Level 5” on Fundstrat’s “Degree of FOMO” scale. Per the graphic, this doesn’t mean that the cryptocurrency market has peaked though. In fact, the firm notes that investors have yet to experience “full-blown” FOMO, marked by a reading of “Level 10”. It is unclear how Fundstrat came to such a conclusion, but the company’s analysts are known for using the Bitcoin Misery Index to determine overall investor sentiment and the market’s overall direction.  Once Bitcoin reaches $10,000, “Level 10” FOMO will grace this market, which last occurred when BTC blipped above $4,500 in late-2017. If history is any guide, the cryptocurrency market will shoot even higher once $10,000 is breached. As Lee wrote on Twitter earlier this month, “[$10,000] will see FOMO from those who gloated about the 90% crash in BTC… and those who saw Bitcoin dead as forever.” Interestingly, just six weeks or so earlier, Adamant Capital’s Tuur Demeester suggested that the cryptocurrency market is still in a stage of “hope/fear”. But, seeing how dynamic this market is, it should come as no surprise that Fundstrat is expecting Bitcoin to enter full-blown FOMO in a short period of time. It is important to note that the public’s awareness of Bitcoin is still rather low. As Redditor “ATC2017” recently pointed out, citing data from Altcoin Analytics, the words “Bitcoin” and “Crypto(currency)” only grace 0.6% of all mainstream financial news headlines, far from the 1.2% seen last May. This corroborates the sentiment that FOMO isn’t full-blown just yet. So, this begs the question — can Bitcoin reach $10,000? According to a number of prominent analysts and traders, the answer to the aforementioned question is a resounding “yes!” MarketWatch earlier this week noted that Think Markets’ chief financial analyst Naeem Aslam believes that Bitcoin is still decidedly bullish. In a research note sent to clients, he suggests that BTC is about to “blast past the level of $10,000”. The analyst explains that BTC being far above its 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages suggest that bulls currently have their hand over the cryptocurrency wheel, opining that these technical levels “define the trend.” To back his call with fundamentals, Aslam looks to the fact that institutional investors are diving into the cryptocurrency space at a rapid pace. As reported by Blockonomi previously, 33,677 Bitcoin futures contracts, the cryptocurrency vehicle of choice for many institutions, were traded on the CME on May 13th, amounting to 168,385 paper BTC. And according to a CME email obtained by The Block, “May is shaping up to be the strongest month ever for CME Bitcoin Futures.” Popular Twitter analyst “Filb Filb” also believes that $10,000 is inbound. In a TradingView analysis published on Wednesday, Filb noted that the aforementioned bout of FOMO, a bullish technical indicator, and the fact that Bitfinex shorts are coming under pressure to cover all lend to the theory that BTC could soon cross $10,000.",

        "passage": "According to a press release published on January 16, the New Zealand police force has opened investigations into the alleged hack of cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia, where criminals stole at least $3.6 million.  On January 13, up to $3.6 million in crypto assets was transferred to an unknown digital wallet from Cryptopia without authorization. Upon discovery of the transfer by company employees, Cryptopia decided to shut down its website as efforts went into tracing the lost assets and what could have caused the hack. On January 14, the exchange posted a tweet informing its clients that the website was down due to the necessity of some “unscheduled maintenance.” Over time, the crypto trading platform repeatedly assured its users that trading would be back in a matter of days, as its engineering team was working on a lasting solution to the issue. However, the lack of communication from the company has raised suspicion from some quarters, as customers believe Cryptopia might not be telling the full story. The exchange confirmed the attack on January 15 via a tweet, calling the hack a “security breach.”  The digital asset platform is currently under maintenance, according to its last update. Also, all trading activities have already been reportedly suspended until the police force and the High Tech Crime Consortium (HTCC), an agency that deals with cybercrime, are done with their investigation.  The police force has established a physical presence at the Colombo Street headquarters of Cryptopia, but contrary to various reports published by the local media, they have not placed the building under a lockdown. Last year saw an upsurge in the number of digital asset platforms that were hacked. According to an Anti-Money Laundering Report by intelligence firm CipherTrace, the total crypto-related attacks recorded in the first three quarters 2018 saw the loss of about $927 million worth of digital assets. Still, it looks like 2019 might be picking up right where 2018 stopped. Just three days into the New Year, Dublin’s local tram system—Luas—had its website hacked, where the details of thousands of users were supposedly stolen. According to the Irish Times, the attacker had sent ransom messages asking for a single Bitcoin (BTC) unit in exchange for surrendering control of the whole system. The attacker threatened to make the publications of private data public if the ransom request wasn’t met within the stipulated time. The local tech department was reportedly able to make modifications to the website to remove the message. However, the page remains offline as of this writing. On January 5, U.S. crypto trading platform Coinbase suddenly stopped trading Ethereum Classic (ETC) after the exchange discovered that the currency’s underlying blockchain had been the victim of a 51% attack. Crypto exchange platform Gate.io also reported that it had lost 40,000 ETC tokens (worth about $220,000). Assuring users of their safety, the exchange also said that it would take care of all affected users’ losses. After days of speculations, ARS Technica reported that the total number of ETC tokens stolen as result of the ETC 51% attack was about 85,000, with a reported worth of around $500,000. On January 12, Gate.io reported that the ETC hacker had returned $100,000 in ETC tokens to the exchange. The exchange claimed that it had no explanation for the hacker’s sudden “change of heart,” speculating that the hack might have been carried out by a white hat hacker. In the release, Gate.io wrote, “If the attacker didn’t run it for profit, he might be a white hacker who wanted to remind people the risks in blockchain consensus and hashing power security.”",

        "passage": "For much of Bitcoin’s life, it was unquestioned. When Satoshi Nakamoto released his creation into the world, digital currencies and blockchains were mere concepts, making Bitcoin the first real attempt at creating an asset that isn’t tied to traditional payment rails, or an underlying governmental system. But, many technologists and innovators have concluded that they can do better than what Satoshi has done, creating hundreds and thousands of spin-offs, better known as altcoins, in the process. And sadly enough, some of these cryptocurrency creators have taken to public forums to draw attention to Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, shunning the project that tacitly spawned their creation.  Brendan Blumer, the chief executive of the Hong Kong-based Block.one, the development group behind the EOS blockchain, recently took to the stage of the DC Blockchain Summit at the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CODC). While Blumer was on stage for a panel on blockchain’s applications in government, business, and other sectors, he brought up Bitcoin. And what he had to say wasn’t exactly cheery, nor did it sit well with the crypto public. The EOS co-creator did admit that he sees Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency and blockchain application, as entirely transformative, but that the network still has drastic shortcomings.  Blumer remarks that Bitcoin transactions, in actuality, cost well above the transaction fee stipulated by the miner market alone, with the actual cost of processing a peer-to-peer transfer potentially being as high as $50 to $100. In subsequent Twitter comments, Blumer continued this narrative. Trying to rationalize comment that BTC transactions actually cost more than the fee in and of itself, he drew attention to miner subsidies, explaining that this supply emission should actually account for the cost of securing processes. He then poked fun at Bitcoin’s transactional throughput and block times, explaining that to transfer BTC to a peer or business, it may take one hour, even if the “three transactions per second” limit isn’t already being satisfied. This, of course, is an exaggeration on Blumer’s end, as the widespread adoption of Segwit addresses allow for the network to process up to seven transactions per second, but his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin’s technical capabilities was made clear. While Blumer’s comments make it sound like he only sees a downside for Bitcoin in the future, his Twitter rebuttals make it clear that this isn’t exactly the case. In a tweet issued in mid-March, Blumer proudly proclaimed that he believes in the narrative that Bitcoin is the next coming of gold if you will — a digital store of value that has commodity-esque characteristics. In fact, he writes that he expects for the cryptocurrency to replace gold as the leading store of value over the next two decades, a sentiment held by the Winklevoss Twins, Willy Woo, Mike Novogratz, among other crypto industry stakeholders.  Responding to the critique he received for his monologue at CODC, he doubled-down on the idea that Bitcoin still has a valid, albeit relatively limited, value proposition. Blumer writes that he loves the world’s first cryptocurrency due to its potential to become the digital gold, but that it is inherently not optimized to compete in the realm of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other use cases. In other words, he is explaining that BTC transactions may be slow and relatively costly, but there’s enough space for both EOS and Bitcoin to exist in a decentralized, digital-based world. And that may just be how Satoshi Nakamoto wanted it. As Dan Held, the co-founder of Interchange, explained in an extensive Twitter thread, the Bitcoin creator likely had many chances to change the cardinal rules — 21 million supply limit, ten-minute blocks, one megabyte blocks, etc. — of his brainchild, but decided against it.",

        "passage": "This week in commercial blockchain development started with a bang. Hyperledger and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) announced they would be working together to the benefit of blockchain technology as a whole on Monday. The two groups have been viewed as rivals in the past, but it looks like they are teaming up so that industrial blockchain uses can grow unimpeded.  EEA executive director, Ron Resnick, said that, The deal that Hyperledger and the EEA struck seems to be simple enough. Both groups have joined the opposite organization, which should help blockchain technology develop faster. The newly opened doors will allow both members from both groups to freely share information, and tap into synergies that exist between the two groups. Blockchain developers are more or less free from regulations. On the face of it this freedom is ok, but from an industrial standpoint, there is little to ensure that a company is buying into a quality product. That is where the EEA comes into the picture. Now Hyperledger developers can access the EEA’s certification programs, and easily show their platforms fit into some of the best blockchain standards that have been created so far.  Read: Hyperledger: Open Source Blockchain Project Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger’s executive director seems to understand the advantages that will come out of this tie-up. He said this in a statement, “Great open standards depend upon great open source code, so this is a natural alliance for both organizations.” EEA members will also be able to work directly with Hyperledger platform developers, and gain insight into how to implement standards as a project evolves. Amber Baldet, has a history of working with both groups. She is also the founder of Clovyr, and former blockchain lead at JPMorgan Chase who has been closely involved in both groups. Ms. Baldet pointed out to Forbes that, Anything that the blockchain community can do to help industry adopt a steady view of DLT is probably wise. IBM has had an easy time selling major companies on their blockchain technology, which is based in Hyperledger architecture. There is no reason why IBM’s platform is inherently better than any other developer’s version of Hyperledger, but without firmly established industry standards, it is tough for smaller companies to compete with an entity like Big Blue. The new level of cooperation between EEA and Hyperledger will feature an open source codebase that anyone in either group will have access to. There will also be a third-party standards organization which will make certification easier for smaller companies that want to develop novel Hyperledger technology. IBM’s take on Hyperledger was recently sold to Walmart as a solution for tracking food in its massive logistics system. It is telling that a relatively recent innovation like DLT can be realistically used to replace vital record keeping systems, with a lead time that is measured in months. Pilot programs like the one that Walmart and IBM are rolling out will help to shore up confidence in blockchain, as long as it is successful. The fact that Hyperledger is being used by Walmart and IBM could be a big benefit to smaller developers as time goes on. A new level of cooperation between Hyperledger and EEA could help the next generation of blockchain developers to connect with larger companies, and demonstrate they are using solid code that will be able to adapt to a changing global environment for data sharing.",

        "passage": "Since the term “blockchain” was coined, a paradox regarding the technology has become a controversial topic in this budding ecosystem. You see, while many detest cryptocurrencies, many traditionalists, especially those on Wall Street, are enamored with a certain form of a decentralized ledger we know as “blockchain,” which Bitcoin itself effectively conceptualized. Such individuals (and sometimes entire banks and institutions) see this advancement as a way to bolster their bottom line.  Funnily enough, however, a technologist working at one of the world’s largest financial institutions recently came out against blockchain, lambasting it in an interview with CNBC. Speaking to CNBC in an interview at the Bank of America’s New York office, technology and operations chief Cathy Bessant openly expressed skepticism towards blockchain technologies. Although her company has racked up over 26 related patents, according to The Next Web — the highest out of any financial institution — Bessant explained she has grown weary of the technology. She explains that she doesn’t expect for the advancement to produce any fruit in the near-term, adding that “in the closet,” she’s bearish. When asked about the patents and the sudden about-face, Bessant noted that she is “open-minded,” hinting that she previously saw copious potential in blockchains previously. She also stated that BofA is ensuring that other companies and entities can’t infringe on its IP, if, by some stroke of luck, this technology “fulfills what some people believe its potential is.” Her firm may have patents in tantalizing potential use cases, like ledger-enabled ATMs and storage solutions for private keys, but Bessant notes that she needs to see an application that is much more multi-faceted. It was added: Despite all this, Bessant quipped that from a moral and fundamental level, she wants to see a technology that “makes us (meaning humanity) better, faster, cheaper, more transparent.” But is the technology she envisions blockchain? She didn’t tip her hand. Sure, everyone wants increased efficiency in a world where things are, let’s say, sticky. Bessant might not think the rise of blockchain will be a catalyst for such a change, but her Wall Street comrades sure do. As reported by Blockonomi, technology giant Cisco recently issued a report on blockchain technologies. Firm researchers claimed that by 2027, as much as 10% of the world’s gross domestic product, could be secured by the innovation. The firm added that by 2021, the global corporate blockchain market could be valued at as much as $9.7 billion. Cisco expects for blockchains to be harnessed in smart cities, the supply chain, and the Internet of Things, thereby pushing this market to staple status. While Cisco was dealing with the hypothetical, JP Morgan Chase has begun to harness the technology for good(?). For those who missed the memo, the institution operates its own Ethereum-related chain, Quorum, which now has its very own digital asset, the fittingly-named, widely unpopular JPM Coin. Fans of Bitcoin and other pure cryptocurrencies have clicked their tongues in disapproval, but the company believes that the digital asset can revolutionize its internal processes and, potentially, retail payments at some point down the line. Even PayPal, who quietly issued its own cryptocurrency for an internal pilot, has lauded blockchains in some respects. In a CNBC “Squawk Box” segment, Dan Schulman, PayPal’s CEO, explained that while cryptocurrency’s use case is limited, he could see blockchain garner traction through this asset class.",

        "passage": "According to data from coinmarketcap.com, with few exceptions (like Litecoin Cash), essentially every single asset on the top 100 list has dropped by between 5.5% and 24%. Bitcoin itself saw a drop to below $7000, and Bitcoin Cash fell below the $1000 mark. In total the market has dropped by $25 billion at publishing time. But what caused this, and how is the cryptocurrency community reacting? Is this the end of cryptocurrency, or just another bump in the road?  It was announced just recently that the CFTC, or US Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched a probe into four cryptocurrency exchanges and started demanding trading data in regards to its investigation. The exchanges allegedly targeted include Coinbase, Bitstamp, itBit, and Kraken. The investigation appears to be tied to the recent bitcoin futures contracts that were launched by CME Group Inc. late last year.  Read about Bitcoin Futures The contracts, which launched in December 2017, were met with the highest price increase in the overall cryptocurrency market ever seen before. This, of course, was met by the infamous sharp decline that was observed from January of this year onward. January also happens to be when the first futures contracts would have ended. The goal of the probe itself is to determine whether or not price manipulation was occurring that would have affected the value of the Bitcoin futures contracts. This in turn could have potentially made a hefty profit for those that bet against Bitcoin. When we think of price manipulation as a concept, it usually relates to various pump and dump schemes. A pump and dump occurs when a small asset (such as penny stocks or a low volume crypto asset) with a low number of outstanding shares or low liquidity is suddenly targeted with a massive buying campaign. This campaign causes the price to double or triple in a very short period. The perpetrators of the pump and dump then engage the second half of their plan, the dump, by selling all of their holdings at the highest price. This then causes the price to plummet and all other investors to suffer heavy losses. Pump and dumps are illegal almost everywhere, and when perpetrators are caught, the punishments can be severe. But what the CFTC is investigating this time is a slightly different take on the same theme. Futures contracts are, in many ways, a way to short the market. In other words, the lower the price is from where the contract began, the more profit investors can stand to earn. And so the sudden and massive drop in price leading up to the end of the contracts clearly raised some suspicions. As for whether or not this probe is directly leading to the drop in price we saw just now, is unclear. In response to the recent market drop, the cryptocurrency community has responded largely as it always does. That being, a mixture of fear, skepticism, conspiracy theories, repetition of the HODL mantra, and re-postings of suicide hotline information. One consistent trend that seems to always appear during these market downturns is individuals claiming that times like this are a perfect time to buy. Some often jest, saying that today is like the Black Friday of cryptocurrency. That being, everything is on sale, and often at a considerable discount. Another worthy mentioned of community reactions is the phrase “I believe in the technology”. While at some point in the past, this phrase may have been used in earnest, it appears now to have become a meme of sorts. That being, while many dabble in crypto markets purely to speculate and in hopes of gaining a quick profit, another portion of investors are true believers in the tech and believe that cryptocurrency is here to stay. However, this refrain seems to only appear en masse during times of massive downswings. It is for this reason that we suspect the phrase has become a meme, or the very least a joke. News outlet 99bitcoins.com keeps track of what it calls Bitcoin Obituaries. It tracks each time that the mainstream media has declared Bitcoin dead. It’s almost certain that with today’s prices dip of going on towards 10%, we will most likely see at least a few further declarations of bitcoin being “dead”. Again we have to remember that at this time one year ago, bitcoin was trading for less than $3000 each. From that point to this year, the Bitcoin valuation has still increased by more than double. And so perhaps if you are a true believer, you too might see occurrences like today’s as a buying opportunity, or a chance to “fill your bags” at a discount. Featured Image via coin360.io",

        "passage": "Waltonchain has just announced their new initiative called WTC-Food. The goal of the system is to provide origin and destination tracking for food products. In an explainer video released by the group, the platform is especially targeted at countries like China that lack robust food tracking systems. As a developing country with more than 1 billion mouths to feed, China has a serious problem on its hands. Specifically, the country has been rocked by food scandal after food scandal, the likes of which would leave the average persons stomach churning in disgust.  Read also: Beginners Guide to Waltonchain How bad are they? Here’s a few. A number of meat sellers were caught substituting mutton for rat meat. Fakes of well-known seasoning brands were discovered on grocery store shelves that contained hazardous industrial chemicals that can cause cancer and other serious and immediate health effects. And of course, there was the infamous melamine scandal where a major dairy company added the industrial chemical known as melamine in order to give it the appearance of a higher protein content. The fallout of that particular scandal is still being felt today, with most parents refusing to buy domestic dairy products of any kind for fear that they will once again contain industrial chemicals. This has led to worldwide infant formula shortages due to gray market exporting and hoarding. If someone buys an apple off the grocery store shelf in the United States, there’s usually enough information available so that the apple can be tracked all the way back to the farm it was picked from. This is important because if something were to be wrong with that apple and a recall needed to be issued, then this information will allow authorities to act in a much faster and more effective manner. In China, however, a system like this simply does not exist. Food seems to be collected a farm, and then shuffled through a mysterious process where it changes hands dozens or more times and then appears on a store shelf somewhere else with no clear indication of how it got there. Not only is this an issue for normal concerns like E. coli outbreaks, but China has a long history of intentional food tampering and counterfeiting for profit as was seen in the melamine scandal. The idea posed by Waltonchain, a China-based project, is to use the Waltonchain blockchain to create a system where food can be tracked from its source to its final destination with checks made at each stop.  If WTC-Food works as advertised, it could prove to be a revolution in food safety not only for China, but for anywhere in the world where ensuring food safety is less than easy. Even if a single apple makes 15 stops between the farm and the grocery store, and is bought, sold, and traded just as many times, hypothetically a blockchain-based tracking system could still follow it. A system like this could also enforce compliance. This is because if you are a middleman in the food chain, you would not want to buy food from another middleman that did not participate in the blockchain. Doing so would cause a gap to appear in the food tracking history. This gap could prove to be unacceptable once more major retailers are in on the program. A simple automated system could check to see if a particular food product has an unbroken supply chain or not, and they could choose to reject items which do not have a clear history. This, in turn, would cost money for the middlemen that chose not to participate. While in theory the WTC-Food program sounds like it could change a lot of lives for the better, there are still a few things we don’t know about it just yet. Generally speaking, Chinese law states that information systems must be subject to government monitoring and censorship. For example, each email provider in China must be registered and provide a backdoor for authorities to get full access to any data they want at any time. With this in mind, we don’t know if the government will ask for similar access to the data, or if they will have some ability to alter or censor records. This is all unexplored territory, but what if an outbreak of a minor illness appears in the food chain and the government wants to keep it under wraps? Will they step in and alter records so as not to cause a public outcry? And from a technological perspective, will the Waltonchain blockchain allow for such modifications to be made, or is its blockchain completely immutable? And if it is immutable, how can it comply with censorship laws? Our fingers are crossed in hopes that the government would see the benefits of securing its food supply system instead of trying to put social order in a position above food safety.

        "passage": "Well, how do you like that? The entire cryptocurrency market is now worth less than the McDonald’s fast food franchise. Following the persistent price drops of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the entire digital asset market is worth less than a company that serves Big Macs, French fries and other low-quality eats.  This creates a real dilemma in the sense that while McDonald’s may not be good for you, people still resort to their local drive-thru if they are feeling rushed and hungry at the same time. They’re not likely to be any nutritional value to what one consumes, yet it somehow gets the job done in their minds. Cryptocurrency, however, offers a store of value unlike anything ever has. It’s built on a revolutionary form of technology (the blockchain) and has the power to grant financial independence to third-world countries and other developing nations, yet prices are falling as so few people are utilizing it. How could something with so many positive attributes be losing out to a franchise built on fats and starches?  Perhaps the big reason is that cryptocurrency isn’t doing the precise job it was built for. Currencies like bitcoin, for example, were designed to be payment coins. Bitcoin was first implemented as a means of purchasing goods and services when one had little to no access to fiat. The idea was noble to say the least, but there’s a big problem: bitcoin is volatile! Its price moves up and down faster than a child on a swing set, and this creates severe issues for companies willing to accept the currency as a form of payment. If a retail merchant is providing a product at a specific price, someone could utilize half a bitcoin to make the purchase. Tomorrow, however, that bitcoin half goes down in value, which means the company lost money in the end. It’s very different from paying with fiat. If you give a company a dollar, they’ll always have a dollar. If you give them one bitcoin, sure – today it’ll be worth $4,400, but tomorrow, it may be worth $4,100, meaning the accepting merchant has incurred a $300 loss. At the time of writing, the entire cryptocurrency market cap stands at a measly $139.7 billion. This is a severe drop from the $800+ billion market cap it boasted last January. By contrast, the McDonald’s market cap stands at $140 billion, edging just slightly past crypto. And yet, despite some gloom-and-doom making its way through the digital asset arena, many companies have no plans to abandon crypto just yet. For example, South Korean technology firm YGGDRASH has recently announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain incubation center. Though prices are falling, and many crypto-based companies are filing bankruptcy due to the consistent price drops, others are looking at the situation as a time of potential growth and are using these troubled weeks to build on something they’re confident can expand one to two years from now. YGGDRASH first announced its plans to the public on Friday, November 23, 2018 at an event called YEED-UP. Approximately 100 additional blockchain companies were in attendance, suggesting that the business side of both crypto and blockchain technology remains large and in diverse. For now, details are rather limited, though it has been understood that the exchange will be known as DEXRADE and will follow a revenue-sharing platform in which all companies that join the exchange or are listed on the exchange will benefit financially.",

        "passage": "While the vision held by many involved in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain is an altruistic world of fewer bad actors, the digital asset market is seemingly plagued with shortcomings. In fact, countless reports have revealed that cryptocurrency trading venues and certain projects are far from infallible, citing concerns of widespread data manipulation (wash trading, etc.) to play at investors’ heartstrings. But CoinMarketCap, the most-visited data provider (and webpage for that matter) in this embryonic industry, is looking to change this with a new initiative.  Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), as the venture has been dubbed by CoinMarketCap, is a consortium of industry companies seeking to promote “greater transparency, accountability, and disclosure” from all firms in the space. In a statement, issued on the day of the site’s sixth birthday, the company revealed that it intends to gather more data points to empower its users to make “more informed decisions,” and to give projects a platform to differentiate themselves from the often non-transparent pack through “enhanced discourses.” It was further explained: Joining CoinMarketCap at launch will be a handful of exchange partners, namely Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, and Bitfinex. More partners are expected to join DATA with time. According to the site, partners will be responsible for suggesting updates to DATA’s transparency policy, evaluating the state of cryptocurrency data, funding transparency initiatives, and harmonizing exchange API standards through CoinMarketCap. DATA’s first order of business is to mandate “all exchanges” listed on its data aggregator to broaden the flow of information by providing live trading and order book data, specifically in a bid to ensure liquidity, order book depth, bid/ask spreads, and “other meaningful measures” are as accurate as possible. Those that do not provide such data will be shunned by CoinMarketCap. If this goes well, DATA intends to then provide CoinMarketCap with “enhanced data and metrics,” like wallet information, historical trade data, team information, develop activity, and so on and so forth, for coins and exchanges. All this comes presumably in response to a report from Bitwise Asset Management, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency-focused investment services firm, that revealed that 95% of all BTC trading activity is decidedly false “and/or non-economic in nature.” As Blockonomi reported, the company noted that “suspicious exchanges” such as the little-known CoinBene, utilizes wash trading techniques like “trade printing” and “monotonic” automatic purchases and sales, to falsely boost their rank on CoinMarketCap. Some might be left asking: if wash trading and similar devious techniques don’t affect prices, why does the cryptocurrency market need ‘clean’ data? Aside from protecting investors and companies from dealing with the wrong exchanges or projects, Hunter Horsley of Bitwise has stated that spotless data vectors may give the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a reason to finally approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). He explains in the end, what truly matters for the SEC is a fleshed-out comprehension of this ecosystem’s ins and outs, not a confirmation that all Bitcoin exchanges, investors, and other players are infallible. And as Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s head of research, recently opined, the discrediting of false volumes show that Bitcoin markets are surprisingly efficient. In fact, Hougan explains that if you are to only take legitimate trading activity into account, Bitcoin’s market looks a lot more like that of gold and other commodities — a healthy sign.",

        "passage": "If one of the fundamental factors driving the development of blockchain technology is to make the world a better, fairer and more transparent place, then leading charity Oxfam are keen to play their part. According to a recent publication in Cambodian newspaper The Khmer Times, Oxfam have just launched their very own blockchain project known as BlocRice. The concept behind the project is to provide the agriculture sector in developing nations with greater levels of power when it comes to negotiating sales with buyers. Moreover, it is also hoped that through the use of cryptocurrency tokens, the underlying supply chain will increase its scope.  BlocRice has decided to launch its first project in the South Asian state of Cambodia – a country that relies heavily on the exportation of agriculture products such as rice. In fact, in 2016 alone, the agriculture sector contributed more than 26.7 percent towards Cambodia’s GDP, subsequently resulting in the exportation of more than 542,000 tons of rice. The project was first rolled out in April 2017 as part of an initial pilot test, with the view of attempting to ascertain whether blockchain technology could ensure farmers sell their goods at a fair price. According to Solinn Lim,  director at Oxfam Cambodia, agricultural stakeholders will be required to engage with the blockchain-based contract, which if successful, will give farmers far more bargaining power than they are currently accustomed to. Furthermore, by utilizing the autonomous and immutable characteristics of smart contract technology, the project will bridge the gap between farmers, exporters and ultimately, purchasers of the rice that are based in the Netherlands. One such organization within the Netherlands that has already agreed to implement the technology is SanoRice, who primarily use Cambodian-based rice for the manufacturing of crackers. As a result, the entire end-to-end supply chain process can be tracked and management within the transparent blockchain protocol. On top of ensuring farmers from within developing nations receive a fair price on the goods they export, the BlocRice project also aims to introduce cashless payments. In collaboration with Acleda bank, the project will assist farmers in their attempt to reach banking services – something than many rural Cambodian regions are currently unable to access. Ultimately, if the process is labeled a success, it is hoped that BlocRice will be expanded not only to other developing nations, but across other agricultural products. This isn’t the first time that a global organization has utilized the benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology with the view of making the world a better place. Earlier this month we reported how Leading U.S. manufacturer SC Johnson – who primarily create goods linked to household cleaning products, are currently in the early stages of introducing blockchain technology to Indonesia.  The idea behind the project is to create an incentivization program that rewards locals for recycling their plastic waste. At present, Indonesia, along with other nations in the Asian region such as China, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, are responsible for more than 55% of the world’s plastic waste that is subsequently dumped in the ocean. By creating an incentivization system, those that choose to recycle are rewarded in the form of tokenization, which it is hoped can then be used to purchase goods and services.",

        "passage": "Ripple is adding two new entities; UAE Exchange and Unimoni to its global payments network. This move comes as the blockchain firm continues to challenge SWIFT and other mainstream players in the international payment scene.  UAE-based Finablr, the parent company of both UAE Exchange and Unimoni announced the news via a press release published on Sunday (February 10, 2019). According to the statement, both companies will go live on RippleNet to enable their respective customers to enjoy blockchain-based cross-border remittance services. As part of the move, both companies will first partner with Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. Consequently, the launch of the service will see UAE Exchange and Unimoni users able to send money to people in Thailand via the RippleNet network. Speaking on the partnership, Navin Gupta, the head of Ripple’s South Asia and MENA region said: Thailand like other places in Southeast Asia is becoming a hub for cryptocurrency adoption, especially in the payments arena. The high fees charged by global remittance service providers appear to be pushing many to adopt the use of virtual currencies in the region. According to World Bank figures, remittance inflows to Southeast Asia grew by 13.5 percent in 2018. Reports indicate that a significant portion of that figure comes from Southeast Asian natives working as expats in the UAE and other countries in the Middle East. Earlier in the year, Indonesian unicorn firm, Go-Jek, acquired Coins.ph one of the largest Bitcoin payment platforms in Southeast Asia. The acquisition forms part of a larger move by Go-Jek to adopt cryptocurrency payments on all of its service platforms. This partnership with UAE Exchange and Unimoni forms part of a much larger goal for Ripple and its plans of establishing itself as a significant player in the global payments ecosystem. To this end, the company identifies SWIFT, the current cross-border payments behemoth as its primary competition. Back in January, SWIFT effectively snubbed Ripple, choosing instead to partner with R3, another blockchain-based startup. The move sees SWIFT working to utilize R3’s legacy trade finance platform within its own operating protocols. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to strike partnerships with Banks and financial institutions around the world. In October 2018, Ripple launched xRapid that utilizes the XRP cryptocurrency in international payments. These mainstream adoption developments, are yet to have a significant impact on the price of XRP. Like the rest of the market, XRP also suffered a dismal 2018 based on overall price performance. XRP declined by more than 90 percent in 2018. The news of the Ripple partnership with UAE Exchange and Unimoni is also another indication of the growing cryptocurrency adoption in the UAE. At the start of the year, the country in collaboration with Saudi Arabia agreed to create a joint cryptocurrency for both countries. The move forms part of plans to foster greater cooperation between the two Middle Eastern neighbors. Reports indicate that preliminary use-case for the joint cryptocurrency will focus on banks as a means of understanding the intricacies of a unitary digital currency for both countries. In 2018, Blockonomi reported that securities regulators in the UAE were planning to create regulations for ICOs in the country. According to the report, the rules aim at legitimizing ICOs as part of the nation’s capital market.",

        "passage": "WeChat, China’s social media giant has banned Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment channels in a newly updated service policy document. The news will come as a blow to over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency traders and brokers who have relied on the service for their business. The WeChat ban is the latest effort by Beijing to ban cryptocurrency trading in its entirety within the country. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is currently enjoying a day of positive price growth with the majority of the top-100 coins posting 24-hour gains.  In a policy update published on Tuesday (May 7, 2019), the Chinese social media behemoth announced the ban on cryptocurrency payment channels. Merchants can no longer publicize any token issuance or even Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading activities.  WeChat users who fail to comply with the directive will have their accounts terminated. According to the announcement, the policy change comes into effect at the end of May 2019. This development isn’t the first anti-Bitcoin action taken by the Tencent-owned social media platform. Back in August 2018, the company began delisting users for providing news and updates about the latest happenings in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry. The censorship drive saw the WeChat accounts of popular news platforms like Caixin, Huobi Zixun, and Caijing to mention a few taken down from the platform. In its defense, WeChat did say some of the accounts were in violation of the country’s instant-messaging services laws. Tweeting about the news, Dovey Wan, founder at Primitive and a noted trusted source for cryptocurrency news out of China decried the negative impact the move would have on Bitcoin OTC liquidity in the country. Since the blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading by Chinese authorities in 2017, traders have been forced to depend on OTC platforms. These platforms utilize WeChat which has over one billion subscribers as a channel of communication. Reacting to the news, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao declared that the effects would only be temporary and that the market will come up with an alternative. Commenting further, Zhao said such restrictions usually forced more people into adopting cryptocurrency.  The Binance boss also teased the possibility that the decision from WeChat might have been coerced. Beijing has consistently made efforts to stifle all forms of cryptocurrency-related activities and have a history of censoring social media platforms. The WeChat announcement is one of the many ramifications of China’s anti-Bitcoin stance. Back in September 2017, regulators banned ICOs before prohibiting cryptocurrency trading. Exchange platforms based on the mainland has to move to friendlier jurisdictions as the government continued its clampdown. Several platforms initially moved to Japan making the country to become the de-facto trading hub in the Asian cryptocurrency theater. Chinese authorities didn’t stop at banning local cryptocurrency exchanges. Back in August 2018, Blockonomi reported that regulators had blocked access to 120 foreign cryptocurrency exchange platforms. In April 2019, reports emerged that Chinese authorities were looking to ban Bitcoin mining. As reported by Blockonomi, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) included cryptocurrency mining in a list of activities that should be eliminated from the country. However, at the time, several commentators like Dovey Wan maintained that the news didn’t spell the death knell for Bitcoin mining in the country. According to Wan, the NDRC recommendation didn’t equate to immediate government action on the matter. Despite clamping down on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, the Chinese government has consistently expressed a favorable disposition to blockchain technology. Several provinces and government agencies in the country have developed blockchain-based solutions.",

        "passage": "Singapore’s financial watchdog recently released a publication, alerting the public about a a suspected bitcoin scam  parading false statements made by an ex-Prime Minister. Authorities say the alleged fraudsters used fake statements published on a phony website to steal funds from unsuspecting victims. Creating fake bitcoin investment schemes using well-known personalities continues to be a popular tactic among crypto fraudsters. Authorities in different jurisdictions urge investors to do proper research before putting money into any venture to avoid falling victims to these elaborate crypto scams.  In a bid to fleece unsuspecting potential customers of their funds, the owner(s) of a fraudulent bitcoin trading website used statements allegedly made by a prominent ex-minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong. Goh was Singaporean’s Prime Minister and later Senior Minister, who also served as the Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Per a publication on the MAS website on Wednesday (July 31, 2019), the scammers set up a fake website, Bitcoin Loophole, which published falsified statements about bitcoin made by the ex-minister. The article in turn, was to lure visitors of the website to deposit a minimum of $250 for bitcoin trading. Furthermore, the financial watchdog stated that these bad actors have used names and images of prominent government officials to carry out fraudulent bitcoin activities. One of such instances happened on September 2018 when scammers created a fake website and published a statement by the MAS Chairman, Tharman Shanmugaratnam. The fake article was intended to mislead customers into divulging sensitive financial details. Scammers got busy again in January 2019, by spreading fake information via fraudulent websites that the Singaporean government was planning to adopt a virtual currency as the official currency. The scammers went further to state that a company was officially marketing the cryptocurrency. In all scenarios, the fraudsters always asked the readers to provide sensitive details (financial and personal), including bank account details. However, the MAS asked the general public to be wary of websites asking for personal or financial information. Also, the public should report suspicious investments to Singaporean authorities. Fraudulent crypto schemes have continued to thrive, with inexperienced investors being the primary target. One of the hallmarks of the fake bitcoin scams is the promise of exorbitant returns on investments. Most times, investors are promised over 100% return on their investments. Crypto scammers in June 2019 floated a crypto investment scam in the name of the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed. The scheme operated from Ukraine and Argentina attempted to deceive people into depositing the sum of AED 1,000 for a huge return on investment (ROI) after seven days. Back in April, France’s financial watchdog, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), warned investors of a bitcoin scam that was targeting young people. According to the AMF, the platform was not registered with the regulatory body and therefore was conducting unregulated trading activities in the country. Blockonomi recently reported that fraudsters impersonated the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to run a bicoin scam via email, with a promise of high returns on investment. Also, there was a report about crypto criminals impersonating Bakkt in order to steal bitcoin. The fraudsters set up a fake Bakkt website where readers would register by providing personal details. Afterward, the readers are sent a bitcoin wallet address where they pay bitcoin into to participate in Bakkt’s second funding round and reap the profits of their investments. In 2018, Lukas Stefanko discovered that three fake cryptocurrency apps on the Google Play store that were used to steal information and funds from unsuspecting users.",

        "passage": "Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has become public infrastructure. And like the genesis blockchain, Ethereum doesn’t have privacy measures baked into its first layer. But if Ethereum is to become a better and more universally practical public blockchain, it will need improved privacy so that users — individuals, enterprises, DAOs, what have you — can leverage its public chain while remaining anonymous, as if they were using cash. That reality has led to recent calls in the Ethereum community for the creation of a reliable mixer, one that could be used to obscure transactions’ participants in trustless fashion.  Now, thanks to the efforts of one “genius” developer, a promising stab at such a mixer has arrived in Heiswap. Built by Kendrick Tan, Heiswap — hosted at heiswap.exchange — is an Ethereum mixer that obfuscates the origins and recipients of ether (ETH) in mixing fixed sums of the cryptocurrency, its blockchain’s figurative fuel. Tan’s work builds off the minimal design specification Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin published back in May, the spec being a near-immediate response to Ethereum community member Eric Conner’s call for a “basic mixing service.”  At the time, Buterin outlined a “simple mixer for sending fixed quantities of ETH.” As such, Tan built Heiswap from that outline and has since released the mixer on Ethereum’s Ropsten testnet. Upon publishing the dapp, Tan was hailed as one of the “[r]andom geniuses” currently working around Ethereum by Buterin.  The mixer uses a smart contract, into which users can submit fixed amounts of ether — e.g. 0.1 ETH, 10 ETH, etc. — that is afterward matched with another user’s similarly denominated sum in order to hide a transaction’s true source. As Tan explained of the project: Similarly to Monero (XMR), Heiswap’s privacy scheme utilizes so-called ring signatures, Tan added: Of course, it must be noted that Heiswap has yet to be audited, as Tan said he didn’t have the necessary funds to enlist an audit by himself. An interesting possibility on the auditing front could come from MolochDAO, an open-source group of Ethereum stakeholders that are crowdfunding Ethereum development projects. Ameen Soleimani, the chief executive officer of SpankChain and the founder of MolochDAO, had previously floated the idea of paying for someone via a Moloch grant to develop a mixer from the minimal design spec Buterin had provided.  Now that Tan has seemingly provided such a mixer, perhaps Soleimani and his Moloch peers would be willing to shift funds to an audit of Heiswap instead. Of course, that’s a matter for MolochDAO to decide, but it’s a possibility that could conceivably gain consensus going forward. Notably, Heiswap is underpinned by smart contract tech rather than servers, which can be seized. That dynamic will work in its favor with regard to censorship resistance. In May, European authorities seized six servers powering the bitcoin mixer service Bestmixer. To be sure, mixer’s aren’t only for criminals, but the aforementioned authorities determined the service had become popular among money launderers. In contrast, Buterin’s mixer design came in response to Ethereum users wanting to join a DAO, specifically HumanityDAO, without publicizing their main addresses.",

        "passage": "For some years now, Bitcoin scam artists have been tricking investors out of their hard earned money using fake, celebrity-related traps and schemes. The latest two celebrities to have fallen victim to these criminals are Australian TV presenters, Karl Stefanovic, and Waleed Aly. These scams are often advertised on Facebook or other social media sites. People who are unaware of how the fraud work do not realize that they are scams until they have already parted ways with their money and can never get it back.  Australians have lost millions to online scams. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published scam statistics recently, which showed that Australians have lost over $14 million to scams in 2019 alone. So far, 1,255 cases have been reported and over $2,248,358 has been lost to social networking scams. The fraudster posts an ad that says something along the lines of “Celebrity X is making a killing with this cryptocurrency-related project.” The victim is then asked to sign up and pay a fee to participate in the project. With the case of Karl Stefanovic, the name of the Bitcoin scam was called, “Bitcoin Evolution.”  Once the victims sign up and pay the fees, there is virtually no way to recover the money or to determine who created the fraud, due to the highly anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies. Along with Karl Stefanovic and Waleed Aly, Elon Musk has been frequently used as bait for cryptocurrency scammers who create fake ads with his image and likeness. Another celebrity who has seen her image used to milk innocent citizens is TODAY SHOW’s Co-Host Georgie Gardner, who even slammed the social network for not doing enough to clean up its community. Facebook, on the other hand, says it has a strict guideline against these scams. The social network’s Guideline’s page explains: Even though Bitcoin scam victims are often not aware of the scams before they fall prey, it can be argued that they have a small amount of responsibility at the very least for losing their money. These celebrity-based Bitcoin scams are just the latest in a long line of internet-based scams that fraudsters have been using for years, starting in the nineties with the Arabian Prince email scam. If you are familiar with the famous Arabian Prince email scam, it was a scam that involved fraudsters emailing random people claiming to be an Arabian Prince who had a sudden need to deposit a large amount of money in a bank account for temporary safekeeping. All you had to do was reply to the email with your bank account details, and you would receive the money. At a certain point, people who allow themselves to fall for these highly suspicious advertisements and internet tricks need to take some level of accountability. If you want to prevent yourself from being a victim of an internet scam, here is a piece of advice, if it looks suspicious and it seems doubtful, it probably is. Stay away from such offers online. The Bitcoin Australian celebrity scam is a symptom of a large cryptocurrency-related fraud problem. The bigger problem is that crypto-related crime is happening on a much larger scale. Roughly $1.1 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in the first half of 2018 alone. Also, cybercriminals and hackers have been hacking corporations, individuals, and other entities, demanding Bitcoin ransoms to be paid to prevent releasing sensitive files or blocking access to their websites permanently. The WannaCry ransomware, one of the most popular ransomware, caused a damage of $100 million to the National Health Services in the UK. ",

Some in the crypto space have suggested that this only accentuates the value and need for Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies.  A Treasury draft legislation outlined the proposed limit. Per the document, which can be found at the below link, lawmakers suggested that preventing consumers from using cash in transactions exceeding the aforementioned sum could “send a strong signal to the community that it is not acceptable to avoid tax and other obligations by paying with cash.” It was added that this proposed legislation is a direct recommendation from Australia’s Black Economy Taskforce. Should the legislation be approved, it is set to come into effect by January 1st, 2020 — less than six months away. Per the legislature, those found in violation of this (honestly Orwellian) rule may be subject to up to two years imprisonment and/or a fine of $25,200.  What’s weird is that this isn’t the first case of a large country setting a cash transaction limit in place. Crypto analyst Rand recently noted that more stringent restrictions exist in nations like Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and Greece. But there’s a silver lining here: the Australian government made it clear that they don’t plan to extend this ban in the crypto space. Regulators wrote that by banning certain digital assets could hamper the industry: Still, the bill isn’t all fine and dandy. This could be seen as Australia’s first step towards a cashless society, one where central bank digital currencies and other government-controlled payment mechanisms are the norm. But there’s an issue with this: privacy. You can already see privacy issues in early-stage cashless societies, namely China. In some regions and through certain applications, debtors are put on full blast, lambasted in public for failing to pay back their creditors. And soon, every step one takes, each transaction one makes, and the words one says online will constitute their “social score”. Those found not to be complying with the party line will be punished, severely. Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time Bitcoin educator, has likened this form of indirect censorship to a violation of free speech. The Greek-British author and coder often claims that money is a language, and that making certain transactions illegal or cutting people out of infrastructure is a growing issue in today’s society. As Rob Paone, a cryptocurrency personality and founder of Proof of Talent, recently wrote on Twitter: “going cashless means a financial surveillance state.” What’s wrong with surveillance? Governments with access to everything can theoretically protect citizens from criminals. But, as crypto researcher Hasu and Three Arrows Capital’s Su Zhu wrote in an extensive post on digital cash, “The specters of terrorism and organized crime are often cited [for the need for survillence]. But this makes the naive assumption that governments itself can never become evil.” The duo writes that cashless societies are less, not more, susceptible to tyranny, overreach, and authoritarian policies that can end up forcing society into a corner. Just look to North Korea as a perfect case in point. A surveillance state or surveillance world is exactly where Bitcoin shines. As BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post published to the company blog, the “censored, centralized, and top-down” digital monies of the future pale in comparison to Bitcoin in a number of respects. “Bitcoin runs via a network of voluntary, independent, and self-interested actors, who neither demand nor require any favours or permissions; a few basis points in transaction fees is literally all they want from anyone,” he wrote, drawing clear lines between decentralized and centralized crypto assets. The former banker went on to note that when, not if, cash is abolished, meaning the death of traditional financial privacy, Bitcoin should see adoption due to the “moral and even psychological” need for the ability to keep information to oneself.",

        "passage": "Last week, prior to the release of Facebook’s Libra, prominent Bitcoin evangelist and educator Andreas Antonopoulos made a surprising comment. In a Q&A Youtube video, he quipped that the corporate cryptocurrency isn’t a threat to Bitcoin, but is instead a threat to Wall Street and traditional finance. The educator attributed his comment to the fact that Libra will presumably cut fees to a minimum, dramatically reduce transaction times, and reach farther than banks can go.  On June 23rd, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) gave a nod to Libra via an extensive report. And just as Antonopoulos predicted, the so-called “Bank For Banks” warned that Silicon Valley in finance could threaten the broader banking industry. For most of their lives, technology companies have stayed away from foraying into financial services. But, as Silicon Valley has looked to bolster its bottom line, firms have begun to take technology and combine it with finance. Google has launched Google Pay; Apple has the Apple Card. And, as you are likely aware of, Facebook and its countless corporate partners (Uber, Spotify, PayPal, Visa, Booking Holdings, etc.) are preparing to launch a cryptocurrency based on a basket of assets deemed “stable”. For the most part, these ventures are innocuous. They are ways to make business more efficient through reducing friction between a consumer and the end merchant. The BIS writes: But, as the entity, a conglomerate of 60-odd central banks, points out, technology companies dipping their toes on finance may also pose a direct threat to “financial stability” and “data protection”. The BIS explains that once Big Tech’s enticing financial services trap consumers, entry barriers can be raised and competition can be stamped out, creating a monopolistic system that may actually hurt mom & pop investors at the end of the day. This act would harm Wall Street institutions, potentially making such banks and funds useless in a world where technology executives have the keys to the financial system. What’s equally as harrowing to the BIS is the potential for Big Tech to harness consumer data to further establish hegemony over everything. The Bank For Bank writes: Indeed, fintech programs have been proven to allow companies to leverage even more data than ever before. A perfect case in point is Robinhood, the no-commission startup brokerage that caters to a millennial audience. The company makes a large portion of its profit by taking the data from user trades, forking it off to high-frequency trading desks, and receiving some commission. Although Facebook’s blockchain division has pledged that Libra will eventually go fully decentralized, many fear that a similar practice may come into use in this new cryptocurrency’s ecosystem.

        "passage": "In 2017, China suddenly did a u-turn on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Within months, the nation went from a leading innovator in this nascent sector to one of the most anti-crypto states, implementing bans on certain cryptocurrency media outlets, foreign exchanges, the trading of Chinese yuan for Bitcoin or altcoins, crypto events, and more. While China has seemingly started to loosen its grip on cryptocurrency actors under its jurisdiction — as made evident by the massive Bitcoin OTC flows purported to be from Chinese traders — the nation’s authorities are still on edge about this industry.  Case in point, a prominent Chinese venture capitalist recently revealed that a massive project based in the region got “clamped down on by the police”, despite the seeming lack of outward wrongdoing. According to Wheatpond venture capitalist Dovey Wan, GXChain, a project which bills itself as “a fundamental blockchain for the global data economy”, has just come under pressure from the police. Citing videos presumably from Chinese social media, she wrote that the firm’s office has been “emptied out and sealed up”. Indeed, the video below shows an absence of employees in the office, multiple police stickers posted on the door, and a lack of company memorabilia in the front lobby.  Wan adds that according to her sources that are “close with the Hangzhou local police”, which preside over the area that GXChain’s main office is located in, the executives of the blockchain startup are being kept in custody “for interrogation”. According to Wan, GXChain’s legal run-in is surprising to her, as she believes that there are “10,000 other Chinese scams” that police could have addressed. Yet, she explains that the police may have cracked down on GXChain because it deals with personal credit data, which the cryptocurrency investor claims is a “highly sensitive business” in China now. Indeed, China has had some issues with its credit market over its history, presumably leading to the current move to crack down on those dealing in the industry. Due to this news, GXChain’s cryptocurrency has collapsed by some 30% in the past day, falling to a market capitalization of $35 million and nearly falling out of this market’s top 100 coins. The coin, GXC, is down to $0.56, from the $0.77 pre-police debacle. The shutdown of GXChain, which Dovey Wan claims was once a “hot ICO” with an actual business model, comes shortly after a number of odd debacles in the Chinese cryptocurrency scene. Of course, in August, a story about a Chinese Ponzi scheme came to the Western world. As reported by Blockonomi, the scam, PlusToken, purportedly managed to steal some  200,000 Bitcoin, 800,000 Ethereum, and a mass of other cryptocurrencies — all amounting to a fiat sum of over $3 billion — from nearly one million victims, most of which originated in the Asian region. Eventually, Chinese authorities crackdown, but there remain ringleaders at large. This was only one of many recent scams with operations in the region, however. Another scam tried to imitate Tron, using the name of the popular altcoin, to secure over $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies from thousand of gullible investors. Police are reported to have started investigating this case. While Chinese authorities aren’t too pleased with cryptocurrency projects not under their control, the People’s Bank of China is expected to soon launch its digital version of the yuan. A senior official at the central bank recently said that the project is ready to be rolled out, while sources told Forbes that the project is likely to be released to large Chinese enterprises before the launch of Libra and potentially before the end of the year.",

        "passage": "Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has vowed to disclose all cryptocurrency listing fees and will donate them to assorted charity projects.  Binance has been a major player in the cryptocurrency charity scene, having previously started the Bitcoin Charity Foundation to battle global poverty. The company describes the foundation as follows: Like many exchanges, Binance has come under fire for allegedly “enormous” listing fees. Most exchanges have been relatively transparent regarding the costs to list on their marketplaces, but this hasn’t been the case with every venture, and funds are typically garnered from initial listing fees, margin accounts and trading spreads among other tactics. However, the exchange’s team has listed the following statement on its website: The company’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (also known as CZ) immediately announced that larger donations do not guarantee, or even influence executives’ decisions regarding which new cryptocurrencies to list. He further stated that the change is designed to increase blockchain use for social purposes and the “greater good,” though he made no mention regarding which charities the company would select to receive donations. The announcement comes at a time when the exchange is desperately trying to clean up its partnerships and listings process per its Korean blog. Binance has frequently been accused by critics of unfair listing processes, showing favoritism towards projects that were willing to pay large amounts of money to have their coins listed on the company’s trading platform. These arguments arose after it was revealed that Binance had demanded roughly 400 BTC ($2.6 million) to list an unknown digital token back in August. CZ later took to Twitter to say that the $2.6 million fee was false, explaining: Binance says that to get a coin listed on their website, one must submit a formal application, never disclose a listing or partnership, and one can never use Binance’s logos in relative marketing material. Unfortunately, one source cites the company’s latest move as simply a way of distracting people from the negative press it’s been getting, warning readers not to be “fooled by Binance’s good intentions.” It says that to this day, Binance has provided “no concrete guidelines” regarding how much it charges cryptocurrency projects to list coins, and says that until it’s truly standardized, there’s no way to understand how much “abuse” is occurring.",

        "passage": "After Apple released its fee-less Apple Card earlier this year, pundits wondered if the offering would disrupt banks. Now we know the company is observing another disruptive though external innovation: cryptocurrencies. On September 5th, Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey told CNN at a private San Francisco event that the company’s leadership thought the tech showed promise for the future. The VP said: The comments immediately caused waves within the cryptoeconomy, where many stakeholders were surprised that a top Apple executive would make forthright remarks on the insurgent payments tech — especially when the company has its own growing Apple Pay service to mind.  Moreover, the comments are notable because Apple simply hasn’t said much publicly on cryptocurrencies to date, unlike some of the company’s largest tech peers — namely Facebook and Google. Apple has done things like add support for the bitcoin “BTC” symbol to its popular mobile devices, but it’s also prohibited cryptocurrencies from being purchased via its proprietary Apple Card — at least for now. In any case, the company appears open-minded in the long run. And Bailey noted that alternative cryptocurrency payment rails are only going to evolve further as time goes on. “If you look at QR code payment solutions, if you look at the long-term potential of cryptocurrency, I think you’ll continue to see that change over time,” she said. FAANG — or Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google — is an acronym for some of the world’s most popular tech stocks. Thus it’s no small thing that some of these companies are increasingly flirting with and working on cryptocurrency tech.  For one, there’s Amazon. The company isn’t at the front of the FAANG pack when it comes to cryptocurrency, but the heavyweight brand has rolled out blockchain services in its AWS cloud computing arm. Who knows what could come later? Elements of Google have been openly experimenting in the fledgling ecosystem. Earlier this year, the Google Cloud team outlined the concept of building hybrid blockchain-cloud dApps using Ethereum, Chainlink’s oracle tech, and Google’s serverless BigQuery platform. And of course the largest player in the field so far has been Facebook, which caused international regulatory shockwaves this summer after unveiling its planned Libra stablecoin. Set to be backed by an association of 100 members including the likes of Visa, Mastercard, and beyond, the Libra has the potential to reach more than a billion users if Facebook can successfully navigate the project’s already stormy adolescence. For its part, Netflix doesn’t appear to have any direct cryptocurrency plans so far beyond producing crypto documentary materials. But those materials can reach a lot of people through its platform, so the influence factor is still there. The grand point here? FAANG’s collective approaches to the space in the coming decade could end up becoming one of the biggest threads in the early history of the cryptoeconomy. It’s no secret that Apple has recently been trying to diversify its revenue options. For instance, iPhone sales dropped 12 percent in the second quarter of 2019. New offerings like the Apple Card help in the company’s diversification efforts, but what if the Apple Card isn’t enough by itself? Making the leap into the cryptocurrency realm could help in that regard, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN. “Given where Apple strategically is focused, a move into crypto could make sense given its sights on further monetizing its consumers over the coming years,” Ives said.",

        "passage": "Enjin’s new Blockchain Software Development Kit (SDK) for Unity could be the start of some big changes in how games are designed. Unity already has a massive developer base of more than 4 million game designers. Enjin has created a new way to use Ethereum-based ERC-1155 tokens that may be a perfect fit for the gaming world. ERC-1155 have some interesting characteristics. Enjin thinks they will be useful to game developers because Ethereum-based ERC-1155 tokens can be made in both fungible and non- fungible varieties in unlimited quantities with a single smart contract. They are also a lot ‘cheaper’ to use and probably won’t choke up the Ethereum network like ERC-721 tokens have.  If that paragraph sounded like technical jargon, no problem. In plain English, Enjin’s ERC-1155 tokens will allow game developers to create items that can be either identical or unique and can also be traded with the reliability and transparency that blockchain creates. Modern games use countless items in their game design and game developers haven’t had the ability to collaborate by allowing items to be shared between different companies’ platforms. Until now, the logistics of creating multi-platform game items wasn’t a straightforward process. With the new SDK from Enjin, that is changing. Imagine being able to use a token from one game in another, or trade it for cryptocurrencies. Enjin’s new SDK isn’t the only platform that could make this dream a reality, but it is being introduced to one of the largest game development communities on the planet. Online gaming has become a massive global industry, but it is still controlled by a few big players. The centralized developers set the rules and you little or no input in how they are applied to the games. Blockchain-based tokens could change the way that games are developed and played. Instead of being limited to one game or ‘universe’ (developer), gamers could use their items across multiple games, or other areas online.  In addition to the new blockchain SDK that Enjin just announced, they will be launching full support for their EnjinX blockchain explorer that was first announced last month. Until now, authenticating blockchain items has only been possible been for people with heavy technical skills. New explorer platforms like EnjinX will be needed to bridge the gap between the tech-heavy blockchain community and regular gamers who want easy access to blockchain data. The way that people interface with each other is changing, and Enjin looks like it is taking a pole position in the race to integrate blockchain with gaming. It would be a mistake to underestimate how much potential there is in the blockchain gaming market, or what could be created with these new tools. Enjin already has more than 30 games and platforms that using its technology to create interoperable items that can be used across what they call “The Multiverse”. The potential for larger adoption of this technology is very real. Unity is used to create games for just about every popular platform there is, including PlayStation and Android. As successes like Pokemon GO have demonstrated, a popular idea can spread across the globe in a matter of days. If people around the world could exchange items with each other, or buy unique items for a broad-based global gaming experience, the platform would take global gaming interconnectivity to the next level. Enjin will be demoing its new technology and giving the public a chance to play around in the Multiverse at GDC later this month, which drew in excess of 25,000 attendees last year. Blockchain has the ability to change many established industries. Gaming might not be the first one to come to mind, but Enjin is creating the tools which could create a new era in gaming. The blockchain integration into gaming is still just getting started, and Enjin is definitely a company that is worth watching.",

As reported by Reuters, the state-owned bank executed an Islamic bond known as Sukuk on the blockchain. The transaction was facilitated on the secondary market, and the distributed ledger technology was used to sell and settle a certain percentage of its $500 million five-year Sukuk. The Sukuk was issued in September 2018, and are scheduled to mature in September 2023.  The bank partnered with Jibrel Network, a UAE-based Fintech who leveraged on the Plug and Play ADGM innovation platform, designed to accelerate the adoption of blockchain for the Islamic Finance Sector. Co-Founder of Jibrel Talal Tabbaa added: According to the report, the new initiative will promote efficiency during bond sales and cut the overhead cost the bank incurs during issuance and settlement of bonds. Speaking on the historical event, CEO of Al Hilal Bank said his bank was proud to be “the first bank to launch a ‘SmartBlockchain Islamic Sukuk,” going further to add: Al Hilal’s decision to issue its sharia complaint bond on the blockchain mirrors a similar decision by the World Bank, who settled an AUD$100 million ($73 million) blockchain bond on the Ethereum blockchain in August.  Read: Beginner’s Guide to Jibrel Network The two-year bond, which was dubbed the ‘Bondi’ for Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument, was floated as a means to improve the efficiency at which third world countries automate their financing processes—moving them away from the manual process of effecting bond sales. The sole arranger of the bond at the time was the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), while the bond’s yield was priced at 2.251% return. About the same time, the World Bank floated its bond on Ethereum’s blockchain; the Austrian government also floated a €1.15 Billion Bond on Ethereum’s blockchain. The bonds which were arranged by the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB), on behalf of the Austrian Federal Financing Agency (OeBFA). Finance Minister Hartwig Loger had remarked in a statement, at the time: The OeKB auction was a historical moment for Austria, as the country pioneered the deployment of sovereign bond on the blockchain network. The 1.1 billion euros bond were made up of two German government bonds, 0.75% Federal Bond 2018 – 2018 and 0.00% Federal Bond 20166 – 2023. According to Angelika Sommer-Hemetsberger, an OeKB management board member, the distributed ledger technology offers a great opportunity for the government to “increase efficiency” while ensuring the “quality of bank processes.”",

In a recent release, Standard Chartered announced they would be working with German conglomerate Siemens’ financing arm Siemens Financial Services (SFS), and trade finance platform TradeIX to create a blockchain-based system for bank guarantees.  The new system will: According to Samuel Mathew commented, who is Standard Chartered’s global head of trade products. Mr. Mathew went on to say that,“The future of trade is going to be all about data,” which means that more blockchain platforms could be working their way out of the banking system at any time. Bank guarantees aren’t a part of most consumer’s lives, but they are a vital part of the global economy. Much like letters of credit, or other forms of trade finance, bank guarantees are a financial product that is ready for change. This isn’t the first major initiative by a group of financial institutions that seeks to revamp an inefficient system using blockchain. Standard Chartered is also working with a consortium of the largest banks in Asia, to create a new platform that would change how trade finance happens. TradeIX CEO Rob Barnes belives that Which is probably why numerous banks are working on ways to spearhead blockchain development programs. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced last month that Standard Chartered would be one of the banks involved with their new trade finance platform, which is based on a blockchain architecture developed by PingAn. The backbone of the system that PingAn developed is already in use, and has created advantages for the entire trade finance ecosystem in mainland China.  Read: Hong Kong HKMA Works With Ping An to Create Blockchain Trade Finance Platform Unlike traditional trade finance, PingAn’s platform offers benefits for both banks and their clients. The platform they created also makes creating merchant accounts much easier, due to its high level of automation. The end result of this is a wider range of potential borrowers, and more oversight for the lending entities within the trade finance market. A string of news reports earlier this year suggested that the R3 consortium was running out of money, which was immediately refuted by the company. R3 is a private organization, so their financials are not accessible to the public. Whatever their current capital position, their Corda architecture is in demand. This announcement from Standard Chartered comes on the heels of a similar announcement from Thailand’s Central Bank, who is reportedly using Corda to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). R3 has been working to tailor Corda to businesses’ needs, and released a version last month that was specifically created to address privacy concerns. Many of the members of the R3 consortium are financial institutions, and have to adhere to strict regulations when it comes to data privacy. Richard Gendal Brown, the CTO at R3, commented publicly after the release of the new version of Corda, Mr. Brown’s views would appear to be accurate, based on the recent announcement from Siemens, Standard Chartered, and TradeIX. Corda was also employed by Ernst and Young, Guardtime and Maersk, for another platform that would address insurance for global logistics. Whether or not there will be overlap between all of these Corda-based systems is unknown, but hopefully synergy is being designed into all of these platforms that deal with similar businesses.",

        "passage": "It’s a crucial time for Facebook, and the company itself knows this. After the official announcement of Libra, last week, the spotlight beamed on the firm and how it intends to handle copious amounts of financial data. In the wake of the hearings and debates that are sure to precede the launch of Libra, the social media giant is taking proactive steps to quell concerns over the security of its cryptocurrency.  Earlier today, the company put out a vacancy for the Head of Data Science at Calibra wallet- its in-house wallet application. Per the job description, the selected candidate will be in charge of monitoring and analyzing user data, while also coming up with resolutions on how these data can be progressively applied. The company is calling for people with quantitative analysis, data presentation, and data handling skills for the role, as well as an ability to “drive data quality across the product vertical and related business areas.” The job vacancy is the latest in Facebook’s sprawling efforts to beef up its blockchain posse. As it stands, the social media company has over 20 blockchain-related vacancies open, as they are looking to double down on the development of Libra and other associated endeavors. However, one of the most exciting vacancies at the company would have to be the one for a Public Policy Manager. The vacancy, which was posted today as well, shows that Facebook is searching for an official who would analyze potential policy risks, while also “responding strategically to related legislative and regulatory initiatives.” While there is a myriad of qualifications, Facebook specifically details experience in “payments, commerce, blockchain, digital identity, cryptocurrency, and related policy issues, as well as experience working on technology policy issues generally.” The company’s search of a Policy manager is especially interesting, considering the situation that the company has found itself in. While there was a lot of anticipation concerning the announcement of Libra, even the staunchest optimist would agree that the reactions so far haven’t been particularly warm. While crypto heads have busied themselves by analyzing the asset and criticizing areas such as its multiple currency peg and whether- or not- it is truly decentralized, authorities have focused more on the risks it poses to customers. A day after the Libra whitepaper was published, Rep. Maxine Waters, Chairperson of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, called for the social media company to delay its development. In response to Waters’ request, the United States Senate has scheduled a July 16 hearing on the currency. Entitled “Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,” the hearing is set to look into a wide array of security issues, including how Facebook expects to ensure best practices in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards and handle Libra customers’ privacy. Countries like Russia have been vocal about their distaste for the currency. Speaking to a local news outlet, Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Market Anatoly Aksakov said Russia won’t legalize the upcoming stablecoin from the tech giant. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also issued a stark warning about the potential risks of the large tech firms entrance into the finance space and how it could disrupt the status quo. The bank made this known in a new economic report titled Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and Risks, where it specifically called out Libra. The institution, which is owned by the world’s central banks said regulators must ensure a level playing field and prevent the abuse of financial data by big tech firms.",

        "passage": "Earlier this week, cryptocurrency ransomware manager Coveware published a report on its official blog, revealing a staggering 90 percent increase in the incidence of ransomware payouts in the first quarter of 2019. For easier reference, ransomware is a form of computer malware that takes control of a host computer and leaves the user locked out. All access to the computer is completely cut off, and information stored on the computer’s hard disk remains inaccessible till a ransom is paid.  The report, which the company claimed was based on standard, real-time data, touched on the costs involved in a ransomware attack. The recovery costs (including any ransom paid to the attacker in order to avert the hack) and downtime costs (losses suffered as a result of the attack, usually measured in missed revenue opportunities and time lags). Coveware’s analysis went on to reveal that the average ransom paid to ransomware attackers was pegged at $12,762 for the first quarter in 2019. This figure represents an 89 percent increase from the $6,733 reported in the company’s Ransomware Marketplace Report for Q4 2018. The increase was mainly attributed to the rise in popularity of ransomware such as Ryuk, Iencrypt, and Bitpaymer; three of the recent malware developed and deployed in attacks on large corporations. The average ransomware downtime (the time needed to decrypt ransomware) increased to 7.3 days in Q1 2019. This is about 15 percent higher than the 6.2 percent reported in Q4 2018. Essentially, this means that ransomware attackers deployed more difficult-to-decrypt malware in 2019. The estimated downtime costs per ransomware per company was also revealed to be $65,645. The report revealed that Dharma, GandCarb, and Ryuk were the three most popular types of ransomware. However, the emphasis was laid primarily on Ryuk, as it has seen the highest increase in adoption levels amongst the top three. Decryption difficulty was pinned to be the single most prevalent cause of increased downtime, and Ryuk was highlighted to be one of the most challenging ransomware to decrypt. The professional services industry (which includes companies such as accounting agencies and law firms) was reported to be the most commonly-attacked ransomware victim. Even though they hold some highly valuable information (case files, tax records, account and banking details, settlement terms, etc.), these firms were reported to be notorious for under-investing in It security infrastructure. So, they’ve become easy prey for ransomware attackers. The average company size of ransomware victims increased from 71 employees in Q4 2018 to Q1 2019. This increase, as well as the estimated downtime cost, was also attributed to increases in Ryuk adoption. The ransomware is known for attacking mid-market and large enterprise with more capital and higher employee counts. However, while all of this paints a gloomy picture for cybersecurity, there seems to be hope on the horizon. Earlier last month, global payment processor PayPal filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a product which will help with the real-time detection of ransomware. The patent’s filing described a “technique for ransomware detection and mitigation,” and it will primarily detect the original copy of files and content on the host computer’s hard drive and collect the information. With the product, a user targeted in a ransomware attack would still have access to the original copy of the content, even if the ransomware already blocked access to the “altered version.” As the product hasn’t been released to the public yet, it is impossible to tell how it will fare against ransomware such as LockerGoga, Ryuk, and Dharma—the main culprits responsible for the increased profitability of ransomware attacks.",

        "passage": "With buy pressure beginning to pick up in the space, the cryptoeconomy’s OG cryptocurrency is looking like it may be on the cusp of yet another bull market. That dynamic comes after the bitcoin price broke through $5,500 USD and popped up to as high as $5,636 on April 22nd for a gain of more than $250 on the day. That $5,636 valuation marked bitcoin’s highest price yet in 2019.  The BTC price is now up nine percent on the week, up 40 percent on the month, and up over 56 percent over the last three months. That green streak has been more sustained than any upward movements bitcoin had last year — a reality that has many crypto analysts wondering if the crypto’s longest bear market to date is officially over. For one, Wall Street crypto hopeful’s Fundstrat projected in their 2019 crypto outlook earlier this month that the bearish cycle that began in 2018 seemed to be waning. In their report, they noted: And, of course, the fabled “golden cross” has returned. A bullish technical indicator, a golden cross occurs when a “relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average,” per Investopedia. Regarding bitcoin’s current context, that means the coin’s 50-day moving price average has now crossed over its 200-day moving average. To that end, it’s the first time bitcoin has achieved such a cross since the fall of 2015 and further fuel for bullish speculation. Beyond the charts, optimism has generally been growing in the crypto ecosystem as of late on the heels of developments that have brought increased attention and activity: After the April 22nd price movement, the market capitalization of bitcoin is hovering just under $100 million. Chris Burniske, a partner at venture firm Placeholder, thinks that mark could reach $1 trillion once another cryptoeconomy bull run hits its stride, that would place Bitcoin over $50k per BTC.  Of course, that possibility is not necessarily unimaginable for crypto stakeholders who were around in 2017, when the bitcoin market cap ripped up to its last peak of $326.5 billion. Therefore the next bull run would need to triple the coin’s last top cap in order to hit the $1 trillion milestone — a climb, to be sure, but one that’s not unfathomable if enterprises participate in the next bull market in larger numbers. Bakkt, ErisX, and Fidiely Digital Assets are platforms meant to facilitate precisely such participation. So while it remains to be seen where the bitcoin price goes from here in the short-term, it’s clear that the crypto’s believers are as convinced as ever that the coin is primed for a bigger future. It’s had an impressive past, after all.  And while the past isn’t indicative of future performance, the trends of digitization and decentralization combined with bitcoin’s first-mover advantages suggest the crypto’s fabled rise toward the daylight of the mainstream is far from over yet.",

        "passage": "Amid fear of environmental hazards resulting from the huge energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, indications are beginning to point toward the imminent closure of the largest mining farm in Medicine Hat. Hut 8, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency mining operator has been pipped as the first culprit going by its overwhelming energy usage in the mining farm situated in southeast Alberta. The Toronto based company, which declared itself as the “largest publicly traded” operator by capacity following the completion of its second mining facility earlier this year, has been consuming 10 times more than the average demand of other mining facilities in Medicine Hat—a city with a population of 60,000 people.  In spite of contributing positively to the economic well-being of the city, the energy requirements of the mining farm have rattled both residents and environmentalists to an extent that spurred authorities in making legislative provisions to cut Hut 8’s electricity demands when necessary. The alarming increase in heat waves has been a cause for worry among residents and this was evident in July when energy usage across Ontario reached an unprecedented height in years. Residents sought solace in their air conditioners just to beat the vent from the all-time high humidity levels. The reliance on fossil fuels for consuming such energy levels has filled environmentalists with so much chagrin. They consider the use of fossil fuels a potential danger and think the ridiculous electricity usage is frivolous. The fact that the source of such high energy usage is not renewable makes it a very sensitive issue. Ted Clugston; the Mayor of Medicine Hat told CBC. The company’s mining facility situated in fifty-six shipping containers on the outskirts of townhouses 180 servers mining Bitcoin and seems to be perceived as an environmental nuisance in spite of its enormous cost. Coupled with its secondary Canadian operations, the company claimed to have mined over 3,300 BTC (estimated at $21.8M) since December 2017. The Medicine Hat facility currently generates 20 BTC ($132,000) daily. Greenpeace spokesperson; Keith Stewart is believed to have peddled the series of misconceptions reported by CBC. Quoting him; “the bitcoin (sic) algorithm works is that it’s designed to waste as much electricity as possible. And the more popular bitcoin (sic) becomes, the more electricity it wastes.”  Read: Bitcoin Energy Consumption: Facing the Environmental Concerns This well-fabricated misconception has left much to be desired. His claims are in stark contrast to the take of Bitcoin evangelist and prolific speaker, Andreas Antonopolous. While shedding light on Bitcoin and electric usage, he said: The need to ensure the Bitcoin network remains at its peak performance-wise cannot be overemphasized especially because of its relevance as a life-saving infrastructure which can bail any economy in cases of natural disasters such as heat waves. Antonopolous is of the opinion that the heavy reliance of Bitcoin on the consumption of electricity has the capacity to trigger green energy innovation.",

        "passage": "Crypto hackers have turned their attention to Outlook, MSN and Hotmail—three email services owned by tech giant Microsoft. According to a report published on tech news media Vice on April 30, multiple cryptocurrency holders, who were affected by a recent hack, have alleged that the hackers also stole their crypto holdings. Trouble started when hackers gained access to the account of a customer support employees at Microsoft. Citing an Email from a Microsoft spokesperson, a separate report by TechCrunch revealed that the criminals found it easy to access customer accounts using the login details of the tech company’s login details. What they found was a treasure trove of data which was used to siphon users’ crypto funds.  A Dutch tech forum carried the complaint of a victim, named Jevon Ritmeester, who alleged to have lost 1 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth about $5,200 as at press time) to the attack. According to Ritmeester, he tried logging into his account on Kraken and upon finding that his account wasn’t accessible, he found that there were several “login changes” notifications in his Email trash compartment. He also found that all Emails that mentioned Kraken were automatically moved to his trash folder. For most crypto investors who haven’t activated a two-factor-authentication (2FA), once a password reset is sent to the mail, the funds are as good as gone. Ironically, Kraken only just announced that it would be initializing 2FA last month, so it couldn’t have been so difficult for the hacker to have gained access to his Kraken account. Reddit, a separate forum, also carried various complaints of victims who experienced similar situations. For instance, a user known as Shinatechlabs claimed to have lost “25,000” worth of digital assets as a result of the breach, but he declined to provide further details on how or when it happened. To paper over the cracks, Microsoft did what large corporations do best. They issued a statement to calm fraying nerves. Microsoft sent an initial Email to the affected users, assuring them that critical information was safe. The company noted that, while the hackers got hold of the Email addresses, folder names, Email subject lines, and the Emails that they communicated with, Email content- including login credentials, passwords, and attachments- were out of their reach However, events that happened since then have shown that this is contrary to the case.  The issue of keeping cryptocurrencies safe online is one that keeps investors and crypto exchanges awake all night. One security measure that is highly recommended is the 2FA, which requires the investor to retrieve a passcode sent to their phone before they can access their cryptocurrencies. The recent cases of sim swapping have shown us just how easy it is to bypass that measure. For a lot of people, storing their funds in a cold wallet with strong private keys is secure enough—not anymore. On April 23, security consulting firm Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) published a report about the “blockchain bandit,” a cybercriminal who had so far been able to steal up to 44,744 Ether (ETH) tokens by guessing weak private keys. While one might think that guessing a private key correctly is a “one in a million” move, ISE reported that this criminal had been able to guess about 735 private keys, all of which gave him unrestricted access to the accounts of his victims. Adrian Bednarek, a Senior Security Analyst at the firm, reported that he came across the criminal by accident. He pointed out that as opposed to accessing these accounts by brute hacking, the criminal simply generated faulty random numbers and looked for faulty code.  From there, Bednarek noticed that some of the wallets that were linked to the private keys recorded large debit transactions into a single address. He predicted that the hack could have resulted from a defect in the underlying codes of the software used in generating them. However, it could also be possible that the hacker used some of the most common passphrases (such as 12345, 0000, abc123, etc.) on multiple private keys and somehow, got lucky.",

        "passage": "According to a document filed by GMO Internet Group, it has been confirmed that the Japan-based internet giant has decided to shut down its crypto-mining division. Through the report, the company confirmed that it would no longer “develop, manufacture and sell” mining hardware, citing extraordinary losses for this decision. The document, which was titled ‘Recording Extraordinary Loss Related to The Cryptocurrency Mining Business Restructuring,’ highlighted the fact that GMOs Bitcoin mining division drew high amounts of losses in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Going further, the document notes: GMO launched its in-house mining division in December 2017 at the height of bitcoin’s bull run. The company chose to operate through subsidiaries, two Switzerland-based corporations, and a mining center. Analysis of the document showed that electricity costs had been a major factor affecting its performance. While these electricity costs have been sustainably high, the dip in the value of the coins being mined has made it increasingly difficult for the company to offset the imbalance. According to the document, GMO will look into moving the Bitcoin mining business to a location where they would be able to mitigate the effects of these electricity costs. As a means of alleviating this, the company said it would “relocate the mining center to a region that will allow us to secure cleaner and less expensive power supply.” In total, GMO’s consolidated losses for Q4 2018 amounted to 35.5 billion Yen (the equivalent of $320 million), while the unconsolidated losses see the figures rise to 38 billion Yen ($334.5 million). The news of the shutdown is particularly shocking, as the company reported favorable performances from its cryptocurrency mining division in Q3 2018. These performances included hardware sales, and overall, the cryptocurrency division of the company reported a total profit of 2.6 billion Yen ($22.8 million) during the third quarter. GMO reported that despite the losses recorded, the “financial integrity” of the company remains intact and has not been affected.” With GMO’s most recent announcement, the company is now the latest casualty the current bear market. Earlier this month, it was reported that Nvidia, a manufacturer of GPUs and crypto mining hardware, was the worst performer on the S&P 500 for the fourth quarter of 2018, as the continued drop in cryptocurrency prices has affected the company’s profits and sales. During this quarter, Nvidia’s stock was massively dumped by investors who feared the effects of the bear market, resulting in a 54 percent cut in the price of the company’s stock. AMD, another crypto GPU manufacturer, has seen the price of its Radeon RX580 GRP slump by about 67% since February. The GPU, which reached an all-time high price of $550 per unit in February (arguably when the drop in crypto prices started), has been affected by the downturn in the crypto market. Interest in crypto mining has significantly reduced since then, resulting in a plunge in GPU sales. In its financial issues report, AMD remarked “negligible” crypto-related sales for Q3 2018. In November, the cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by over $100 billion. In that time, it was reported that cryptocurrency miners in China were massively selling off their mining hardware as a means of saving their businesses and abating the effects of the losses which they had incurred. As the crypto mining business continued to drop in profitability many of these miners ended up losing their businesses.",

        "passage": "As the bitcoin price crossed over $12,000 USD for the first time this year on late June 25th, traders scarcely had time to notice before buy pressure pushed the genesis cryptocurrency’s valuation up more than $1,000 further in a matter of hours. Indeed, within the first few minutes of June 26th, bitcoin was trading as high as $12,861, a price the bellwether cryptocurrency hovered near into Wednesday afternoon. At the time of this article’s writing, BTC had broken above $13,300, the coin having risen $1,800 over the previous 24 hours to give it an intraday gain of 16 percent.  It’s the latest surge for the cryptocurrency, which has been on nothing short of a tear in recent weeks. Bitcoin has gained $4,000 over the last month and roughly $9,000 over the last three months. The OG crypto is now up 107 percent on the year and down only 35 percent from its all-time high of $20,000, which was reached in late December 2017 at the peak of the cryptoeconomy’s last bull market. Notably, with the market capitalization of BTC presently at $228.63 billion, the bitcoin dominance rate — the cryptocurrency’s share of the entire cryptoeconomy’s market cap — is over 60 percent for the first time since 2017. Fundstrat Global Advisors’s Tom Lee, one of Wall Street’s most vocal cryptocurrency analysts, noted back in April that bitcoin has tended to see its biggest price runs during short periods of time — namely within the span of 10 days on average. That’s not to say that BTC only sees large uptrends during single 10-day lots in any given year. Rather, the dynamic indicates that when bitcoin starts to move up, it can move very fast in acute bursts. For example, it took just over two weeks for the bitcoin price to spike from $10,000 to $20,000 during the 2017 bull run. It remains to be seen if bitcoin can match that rise — and its speed — in the coming days, but such a trajectory is as conceivable as ever if the current marked uptrend is any indication and with mainstream attention starting to materialize around the cryptoeconomy once more. Indeed, the bitcoin price first eclipsed $10,000 for the first time this year on June 21st, less than one week ago. It’s moved up considerably after that, and it may have further momentum yet. With the end of Q2 2019 closing in, BTC is now in the midst of its best-performing quarter since the cryptocurrency spiked up 230 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Ether, the figurative fuel of the Ethereum network and the cryptoeconomy’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also enjoyed a considerable run on June 26th. At the time of this article’s writing, ETH was trading over $355, rising $40 on the day to give the second most popular cryptocurrency an intraday gain of approximately 12 percent. Notably, ETH is up 150 percent over the last three months, though it’s still down 24 percent on the year and down 76 percent from it’s all-time high of $1,431, a peak it reached in early January 2018. Over the last three years, however, ether is up a whopping 2,354 percent. The price surge comes as the Ethereum community has been buzzing over numerous recent developments around their blockchain, perhaps most importantly the tentative plans to launch the “ETH 2.0” Beacon Chain on January 3rd, 2020. There’s been plenty of other peripheral activity, too. For example, new DeFi possibilities like the PoolTogether “no loss” lottery have recently arrived, as well as plans for new layer-two scaling solutions like the Phonon Network (note: the network will also work with Bitcoin and later even more blockchains). Moreover, only days ago cloud computing giant Cloudfare unveiled an Ethereum Gateway, which well let users interact with Ethereum without having to download software.",

        "passage": "You know it’s a Bitcoin (BTC) bull market when staunch crypto cynics turn into believers. Mark Mobius, an 82-year-old legendary emerging markets investor and fund manager, has continued his conversion into a cryptocurrency apostle this week. According to a quote on the Bloomberg Terminal, first spotted by lauded crypto commentator Three Arrow Capital’s Su Zhu, the multi-millionaire told the outlet that he is keeping a close eye on Bitcoin.  Most notably, however, Mobius once lauded China for cracking down on cryptocurrencies, claiming that the only use for some of these assets is “illicit activities”. This has been proven to be baseless postulation, as according to recently-published Chainalysis data, a mere 1% of BTC volume is used on the dark web.  Anyhow, Mobius seems to be well on his way to joining the ranks of those cautiously bullish on cryptocurrencies. But why exactly? Well, as established in an interview earlier this year, Mobius believes that digital assets can find use in today’s ever-changing economy. Responding to an inquiry about how Bitcoin and cryptocurrency can aid Venezuela, he specifically looked to this asset class’ viability in global money transfer. Indeed, compared to traditional mediums like MoneyGram and Western Union, which have and often charge over $30 for one transfer that may take days, BTC can be sent to anyone in the world for around $1, within an hour, and without the hassle of attending a physical store. That’s not all. In the July Bloomberg interview, Mobius explains that he is keeping an eye on cryptocurrencies due to increased liquidity. Indeed, over recent months, this budding market has been on the receiving end of an influx of increased volume. Case in point, Bitcoin futures on the CME — one of the world’s leading derivatives market — saw a stellar June. During the month, open interest in the CME’s Bitcoin futures hit 6,069 contracts, amounting to over 30,000 BTC. And the number of clients holding over 5 contracts moved from 46 to 49 over June, implying that bigger investors are starting to trickle back into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This growth in volumes has been aided by growth in the security, efficiency, attractiveness, and sheer count of trading platforms. Fidelity Investments‘ Bitcoin trading desk comes to mind. And soon-to-launch onramps from TD Ameritrade, E*Trade, ErisX, Bakkt, and LedgerX should only exacerbate fiat inflows. It is important to note that Mobius still has his doubts, though. In an interview earlier this year, he stated: Anyhow, it is very interesting to see Mobius acknowledge that he may purchase cryptocurrencies at some point in the future. This validation, some hope, may have somewhat of a domino effect on Wall Street. Mobius’ acceptance of cryptocurrency comes as some big names in finance and media have begun to give Bitcoin its dues. In a recent article, The Financial Times, which is a prominent business news outlet read by some of the world’s most prominent investors and funds, lauded Bitcoin as a “potential” safe haven asset. Tyler Cowen, an economist that frequents Bloomberg’s op-ed column, gave four reasons why he believes Bitcoin will succeed. This caught many aback, as the investor was previously a Bitcoin bear. Also, Joe Kernen, one of the hosts of CNBC’s popular show “Squawk Box”, has recently begun to question fiat monies on air as he simultaneously lauded blockchain and Bitcoin. There is one big kahuna for Bitcoin’s community to convince of the value of digital money, though. Warren Buffett is his name. But what the billionaire investor says about the leading cryptocurrency and its ilk might not even matter, because, after all, the “oracle” missed out on the Amazon and Google gravy trains.",

        "passage": "Canada’s flag carrier Air Canada has signed an agreement with Swiss start-up Winding Tree to participate in a blockchain-based open source travel platform. The letter of intent signed by Air Canada with Winding Tree is expected to remove bottlenecks associated with the distribution and sale of air travel products. The Swiss start-up will be saddled with the responsibility of addressing the malady through the development of an open-source platform for travel distribution so as to ensure customers can have  better access to inventories directly from the airline.  Director of Global Product Distribution for Air Canada Keith Wallis expressed enthusiasm in the foresight shown by the management in leveraging the next generation technology for more efficient service delivery. Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Winding Tree Pedro Anderson commended Canada Airline for being a front-runner in the integration of such an innovative technology into its operations. “As the first North American carrier to work with Winding Tree’s public blockchain platform, Air Canada is showing itself to be a real leader in innovation,” he noted. Founded in 1937, Air Canada boasts of the largest fleet size and volume of passengers making it the largest airline in Canada. Its outreach as a charter air transport caters to passengers and cargo in 207 destinations across the globe. The company celebrated its 80th-anniversary last year with the launch of a red and black aircraft livery. With services spanning over 220 airports on six continents, Canada’s flag carrier ranks among the top 20 largest airlines in the world. Winding Tree started in 2017 as a blockchain-based, decentralized, open-source travel distribution platform with the objective of providing cheap traveling logistics for consumers while ensuring suppliers also maximize their returns. Its operation of an open competition helps to eliminate the barriers that might be encountered by new entrants in the airline industry. The company also caters to consumers by eliminating exorbitant transaction fees that could increase the cost of travel. Its innovative services promote an enabling environment for small companies to thrive with big players in the travel industry. The integration of blockchain technology in the operational processes of airline companies is becoming a trend adopted by players in the industry. Earlier this month, Air France KLM took the necessary step to enhance the integration of Blockchain Technology into the travel industry. The advancement was aimed at improving the supply chain and logistics in a way that provides affordable travel offerings to customers and increased profitability for suppliers. With the Blockchain technology, the number of intermediaries is drastically reduced, and users can have a more direct access to the airlines. Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) also partnered with TravelbyBit in August 2018, to introduce blockchain enabled payments for shopping activities in its terminals. Shops and stores such as Botanist, Windmill & Co., Spoon, and Fort Espresso will benefit immensely from the innovative system which has now enabled customers to make payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash among other digital currencies. The partnership consolidated the aim of Brisbane Airport to provide an enabling environment for community projects, local businesses, and passenger experience. While speaking, Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) General Manager Strategic Planning and Development Roel Hellemons said, “Many people around the world have made money investing in cryptocurrencies, and a lot of these people travel internationally, so it makes sense to offer a digital currency experience within our terminals.” Disclosing plans to expand the usage of cryptocurrencies, he stated, “This is just the beginning for us as we hope to expand the digital currency options across the business, so watch the space. “",

        "passage": "While Bitcoin continues on its parabolic advance, market researchers say there is a difficult situation currently developing in major cryptocurrency exchanges that could soon have an effect on prices. Large capital outflows currently occurring on platforms like Bitfinex are causing trading deficits that may begin to manifest in the Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, traders and analysts say that the top-ranked cryptocurrency is due a retracement after surging 125 percent since the start of the year.  According to Bloomberg, traders are making a run on Bitcoin exchanges en masse, withdrawing large amounts in the process. London-based blockchain data platform TokenAnalyst say the trading deficit on prominent exchanges like BitMEX, Kraken, Binance, and Bitfinex stands at over $620 million in less than seven days. Commentators, traders remain concerned over Tether (USDT) liquidity issues amid the recent revelation that Bitfinex and Tether covered up losses of about $850 million. Speaking on the issue to Bloomberg, John Griffin, Professor of Finance at the University of Texas declared: This assertion of traders pulling out of USDT markets in favor of holding BTC positions holds true given the emerging trend of market indicators highlighting Bitcoin as being in the overbought position. Bitifinex alone has seen withdrawals of about $1.7 billion since the news of New York Attorney General (NYAG) charges against the company came to light. Bitfinex, however, announced that it had raised more than $1 billion from private investors and companies.  At the time, Bitfinex executives said the speed of the capital raising drive was proof that the company still had the overwhelming confidence of investors both within and outside the cryptocurrency industry. Both Tether and Bitfinex have a history of controversy stemming from banking relationships, market manipulation, and liquidity. Tether still remains the dominant stablecoin despite its control of the stable currency market dropping to 75 percent in Q1 2019. The current bullish sentiments in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market could be masking the massive capital outflows from cryptocurrency exchanges. However, this trend could further exacerbate the growing sell-side pressure which could cause a retracement in the BTC price. Trend analysis from different analysts is beginning to point to the current parabolic advance as being too steep to maintain. The top-ranked cryptocurrency hasn’t been able to stay above $8,000 with each spike above $8,100 met by a downward trend reversal.  If more traders accumulating BTC at the moment decide to take their profits at the current level, then the massive sell-off could trigger a downward swing to mid-November 2018 levels. Some projections even have a much larger retracement for BTC to below $5,500 and $4,500 which correspond to the 50-day and 200-day moving average price levels. For the moment, BTC is up more than 125 percent since the start of January 2019, adding more than $2,000 in May 2019 alone. The Bitcoin market capitalization has also grown to more than $140 billion which has pushed the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to almost $250 billion. A retracement to previous support level could cause a cooling of the hype that has been building over the past few days. Bitcoin searches according to Google Trends had even reached a six-month high.",

        "passage": "According to an official announcement published on April 9, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has issued a stern warning to the people of France about Kuvera LLC, a local company that is reportedly offering training modules and specialized software for trading on highly speculative products, including foreign exchange markets and digital assets. The AMF, which regulates the stock market in France, warned the public about the company, claiming that it has not gotten any authorization from the regulator to provide any trading activities within the country.  According to the stock market regulator, the company “offers the opportunity to subscribe for training courses and software solutions presented as an aid for investing in the Forex market and in crypto assets.” It also added that the company has been known to target France’s young people, particularly its high school students. The company, whose operations have now been outed, reportedly operates under two separate brands, Kuvera France and Kuvera LLC. Both brands are also said to be subsidiaries of Investview, a software company based in the United States. Back in September 2018, Investview, which itself operated under the brand name Wealth Generators at the time, was fined $150,000 by the United States Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CTFC). At the time,  the securities regulator had accused the company of illegally offering binary and forex trading options to retail investors across the country. Over the past few months, the AMF has built a reputation for being particularly tough on companies and websites which were either unregistered or were deemed to be promoting “unauthorized” services and content. Via an official announcement, it blacklisted 21 investment and crypto websites in September 2018, claiming that they were “unauthorized” and dealt in offering “atypical investments.” Also, in December 2018, the regulator published an announcement saying that it had blacklisted four websites, on the grounds that they provided crypto offerings without receiving the required permission. The actions of the AMF also seem to mirror the perceptions of French authorities towards the crypto industry in a way. While crypto activities are still being carried out in the country, there have been several hints pointing towards a potential ban. In March 2019, French financial expert Éric Woerth made headlines for suggesting a “ban on all anonymous cryptocurrencies.” Woerth serves as the head of the Finance Committee of France’s National Assembly, and last month, the Committee put together a comprehensive report on blockchain technology and crypto assets. In the foreword to the report, Woerth argued that it would be “appropriate” to ban all crypto-related activities that are based on the objective of enhancing use anonymity. His remarks read: The document didn’t specify the extent to which Woerth would like for these anonymity coins to be banned. It could be anything, from imposing severe penalties on local exchanges that list their trading options to imposing a complete ban on the use of the assets.",

        "passage": "Carrefour, one of largest retailers in France and the world, has seen produce sales improved year-over-year in products the market chain started tracking with blockchain technology. That’s per Carrefour blockchain head Emmanuel Delerm, who confirmed in new comments to Reuters the company is preparing to track dozens of further items with blockchain after an initial run tracking the supply chains of their sourced eggs, milk, pork, grapefruit, and beyond seemed to improve customer trust, and thus sales.  As such, the retailer is looking to extend that trust into further food products and, eventually, merchandise. Its blockchain system, leveraged with the help of IBM, allows shoppers to use QR codes to check supported items’ logistical data, like where and when cheese was produced — information that’s increasingly desired by increasingly conscientious contemporary consumers. Customers simply prefer options they can trust, as Delerm explained it: Blockchain is routinely touted as an auditability solution, with logistics being among the tech’s  most promising use cases, its proponents say. Carrefour’s position — that of a global retail powerhouse — and its results will undoubtedly influence competitors in the industry to explore similar systems in their own operations. Of course, Carrefour isn’t the only major retailer already delving into blockchain, either. This week, a Walmart spokesperson confirmed the company had come aboard with a consortium that’s developing a blockchain for pharmaceutical logistics. That group, MediLedger, is no slouch, boasting major members from the wider pharmaceutical industry like Pfizer and Cardinal Health. For its part, Walmart is the largest retailer in the world by revenue as of 2018, having pulled in more than $500 million USD on the year. So the consortium is poised It’s not the corporation’s first rodeo when it comes to blockchain supply chain work, however, as Walmart is already counted among the members of the IBM Food Trust, which is aimed at a “smarter and more sustainable food ecosystem.” Like how JP Morgan uses its own Quorum, a permissioned version of Ethereum, in its blockchain operations, the MediLedger group runs its own private and modified version of Ethereum. MediLedger’s version relies on Proof-of-authority (POA) consensus as opposed to Proof-of-work (POW) consensus. Walmart’s joining in at a time of heightened activity, as MediLedger is running a blockchain pilot with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this summer. The project will be focused around auditing prescription drug flows. Notably, the MediLedger blockchain uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to allow for auditability while also keeping transaction details private. The enterprise focus on ZKPs has been mirrored in other recent efforts, most notably from JP Morgan’s Anonymous Zether and EY’s Nightfall tools. For blockchain to reach mainstream adoption, having the world’s largest companies embrace the tech would naturally be a strong place to start. Carrefour’s and Walmart’s aforementioned efforts would seem to be two such dominoes. Another would be the advance of TradeLens, a shipping logistics blockchain platform that’s been developed in collaboration between Danish transportation conglomerate Maersk and IBM. Maersk is the world’s largest container ship business, and last week the company enlisted CMA CGM and Mediterranean Shipping Co — two of the international stage’s other largest shippers — aboard TradeLens. The grand question for now is whether these large enterprises are just doing their homework, or if blockchain can become the new status quo in supply chain flows — not just in the retail and shipping sectors but beyond.",

Users will be able to manage their portfolios using the app regardless of their location or whether or not they have their Ledger wallets with them.  Ledger Live is now available on iOS and Android devices. The app reportedly comes with a wide array of nifty features, including the ability to easily configure the hardware wallet. Users can also check the authenticity of the device and import accounts from the desktop version of the Ledger Live. The app comes with increased levels for security, including Touch ID, Face ID, and password protection. Also, the Ledger Live provides support for over 1,000 digital assets, which can easily be stored on the platform. With the app, users can manage their balance, check their transaction history, get quick and easy reviews of their account history, make transfers with their account, and much more. Meanwhile, users of Ledger Blue and Ledger Nano S will be able to make use of Ledger Live or their devices as well, albeit to a limited level. Android users will be able to use the app for effecting transactions, as long as they have an OTG cable. However, iOS users don’t have this feature just yet.  The new Ledger Nano X is the latest product from Ledger which features bluetooth connectivity and is available for pre-order now, with shipping due in March 2019. We have obtained a copy of the new wallet from ledger for purposes of a review which we are carrying out at the moment. Ledger seems to be focusing on security after the blowback that came from researchers who claimed to have hacked into the Ledger Nano S, the Ledger Blue and the Trezor One at the 35C3 Conference. During the 35C3 Refreshing Memories Conference, the researchers showed that they were able to get the private key of a Trezor One hardware wallet by flashing its custom firmware. They also claimed that they were able to install any firmware on a Ledger Nano S. A member of the team claimed, “We can send malicious transactions to the ST31 [the secure chip] and even confirm it ourselves [via software,], or we can even go and show a different transaction [not the one that is actually being sent] on the screen.” Considering the Ledger Blue, a hardware wallet that comes with a color touchscreen, the researchers claimed that they were able to transport signals to the screen via a long trace on the motherboard, so that the hardware leaked the signals as radio waves. When a USB cable is connected to the wallet, the leaked signals become strong enough that they could easily be received through various meters. Still, Ledger responded to the claims made by the researchers at the conference, where it stressed that the perceived security vulnerabilities didn’t pose any threats to the wallet’s security, chastising the researchers for not going through the appropriate channels. “Ledger values all attempts to compromise our hardware wallets. We strongly believe that our Bounty program is the way towards continuous security improvements,” Ledger had explained in the post.",
