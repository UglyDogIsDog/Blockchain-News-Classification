        "passage": "It seems that the revival in the cryptocurrency markets has been heavily benefiting Square, a financial services and technology firm headquartered in San Francisco with a swelling love for Bitcoin. Per the firm’s latest shareholder letter, which was published on August 1st, Square made over $100 million in Bitcoin-related revenues, representing a small yet fair portion of its operations.  The shareholder states that in the second fiscal quarter of 2019, Square’s flagship product, payments app and lite-Bitcoin exchange Cash App, brought in $125 million in BTC revenue. Over 90% of revenue in Square’s subscription, services, and transaction bucket came from its barebones Bitcoin exchange, which supports simple buys and sells. Due to low profit margins in the exchange business, the firm made away with $2 million in Bitcoin-related gross profit. According to an analysis of the firm’s history with Bitcoin by The Block, Cash App’s BTC revenues are nearly double (90%) that of last quarter, during which the firm snagged $65.5 million in revenues. Q2 2019’s revenues are also up more than 240% since Q2 of 2018. The rapid uptick in interest can be attributed to two things: Firstly, the value of Bitcoin skyrocketed from the start of Q2 to the end of Q2. In fact, if Square follows a normal fiscal quarter, BTC rallied by approximately 200% during the quarter, moving from $4,000 to the $12,000 region. With this rapid swing higher, which caught many bears with their pants down, trading volumes across exchanges the industry over spiked, which was a trend supported by an increase in the mainstream coverage of cryptocurrency. Secondly, the so-called “stacking satoshis” movement, which sports the memorable hashtag #stackingsats, gained lots of traction this quarter. Popularized by Matt Odell, Marty Bent, American HODL, and other personalities on Bitcoin Twitter, this movement promotes the repeated purchase of small portions of BTC through Cash App. While it isn’t clear how much of Square’s Bitcoin revenues is related to devotees of the stacking movement, it likely hasn’t hurt. Square’s rapidly growing Bitcoin exchange business comes as the fintech firm’s crypto division has brought on its first staffer. Announced back in mid-June, the Jack Dorsey-headed firm brings on Steve Lee, a former director of Google, where he headed work on Google Maps, and an ongoing evangelist for and contributor to Bitcoin. The Silicon Valley veteran also is an angel investor of Lyft, Pinterest, and other technology startups. It isn’t clear exactly what Lee’s role is at Square Crypto, or what the Google alumnus is currently working on. The firm is currently looking for open blockchain developers but has been quite picky with who to choose, claiming that it has received over “1,500” resumes. Square is expected to make its first developer hire in the coming weeks. By the end of the hiring period, chief executive of both Square and Twitter, Jack Dorsey, will have handpicked one or two designers and three to four blockchain developers. Dorsey’s vision is to promote the viability and use of public blockchains. For now, Square Crypto’s staff will be focusing on Bitcoin. In a recent “ask me anything” on Twitter, Lee took some time to answer some of the crypto community’s inquiries about the project. During that, Lee explained that his division will be “focusing on Bitcoin”, noting that it has the longest lifespan of any cryptocurrency and needs to be worked on a lot to achieve mass adoption. This lines up with the vision put forth by Dorsey, which he has shared with comedian-turned-legendary podcaster Joe Rogan and cryptocurrency-friendly outlet Quartz. He said through those outlets that he believes that Bitcoin is best suited to become the Internet’s native currency.",

        "passage": "Another cryptocurrency theft is in the books. Three individuals have been arrested in Bulgaria on suspicion of stealing cryptocurrency funds worth more than $5 million USD. The crypto arena has always been wrought with theft, and virtual assets seem to attract some of the most malicious players in the industry. Two of the biggest thefts in recent years that likely come to mind include Mt. Gox in February 2014 and Coincheck last January, both of which occurred in Japan.  Mt. Gox – widely considered the largest bitcoin exchange at the time – was the victim of a hack that saw over $400 million in BTC funds disappear practically overnight. To this day, many questions regarding the hack have gone unanswered, and Mark Karpeles, CEO of the exchange, ultimately spent over a year in a Japanese jail for his alleged role in the scandal. For nearly four years, Mt. Gox held the record for the largest cryptocurrency hack in history until Coincheck in January of 2018. Over $500 million in assorted crypto funds disappeared, prompting Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to become involved in the regulation and monitorization of the country’s crypto exchanges. The FSA later began sending warning letters to all Japan-based trading platforms and told them that if they didn’t up their security protocols to prevent further hacks, they would be shut down permanently. Though this latest robbery isn’t quite on the same level as Mt. Gox or Coincheck, it’s an ugly reminder that the cryptocurrency scene remains vulnerable and open to attacks, and that safety measures still aren’t where they should be. A statement regarding the robbery was released by the Bulgarian Prosecutor’s Office on Monday, November 26, 2018 explaining that local police had taken three men into custody on suspicion of cryptocurrency theft. At press time, it is alleged that the amount stolen by the individuals exceeds $5 million. However, approximately $3 million of that money has already been recovered. In addition, authorities say they’ve seized a $34,000 car owned by one of the individuals. It is believed the vehicle was purchased using the stolen crypto funds. The arrests come after the Prosecutor’s Office launched an investigation into the matter five months ago in June. Representatives say this is the first case of its kind in both Bulgaria or Europe. Prosecutors state that the alleged thieves were highly skilled in coding and related computer science, which allowed them to garner the crypto funds for so long without being noticed. Police have since raided the three men’s primary location and seized several pieces of equipment including hard drives, desktop computers and a set of notebooks containing a legion of both fake and legitimate accounts that police say the men were using to store the cryptocurrency. Thus far, only one of the men has posted bail (approximately $29,000). Cybersecurity firm CypherTrace recently released a report suggesting that nearly $1 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen since the beginning of the year – up by nearly 250 percent since 2017. Furthermore, it says that roughly 97 percent of bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading occurs via non-regulated exchanges, making investors and traders even more susceptible to thieves. Recent examples of similar thefts covered by Blockonomi include a SIM-swapping case where a northern California resident’s phone number was used to steal money from his Coinbase and Gemini accounts. It is estimated that the thief stole as much as $1 million, and only $300,000 has been recovered at press time. In addition, a Brooklyn-based man is now facing up to five years in prison for allegedly selling phony initial coin offerings (ICOs) to unsuspecting customers.",

        "passage": "Argentina’s Alto Viaje just teamed up with Bitex to allow the use of Bitcoin on the nation’s SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico) payment platform. SUBE is a card-based system that can be used on numerous modes of transportation across Argentina, including subways, buses, and trains. Last week Cointelegraph in Spanish reported that Alto Viaje, which is a third-party platform, expanded its payment methods to accept Bitcoin with the help of Bitex. It previously accepted PayPal, as well as Rapipago, which is a payment system native to Argentina. The recently announced program will allow more than seven million people who currently use the SUBE system to pay with BTC. Manuel Beaudroit, who is the CMO at Bitex, commented that his company was happy to work with Alta Viaje to expand the use of Bitcoin.  Unlike many countries, Argentina has been willing to let crypto-based businesses and payment platforms grow. In addition to being home to one of the first banks that used BTC to circumvent the SWIFT system, Argentina is home to a growing number of BTC ATMs. Banco Masventas made headlines last year when it worked with Bitex to transfer money out of Argentina with BTC, a move the bank claimed was much faster and cheaper than using the aging SWIFT system. Argentina has dealt with numerous banking restrictions over the last 20 years, which may be part of the reason why the nation is happy to let the crypto economy take root. Unlike fiat currency, cryptos can be used to transfer money on a peer-to-peer basis. Cryptos have a major advantage in a geopolitical environment that is growing more complex. Argentinians have dealt with major financial problems since at least the 1970s, and many lost access to their money during the crisis that started in 1999. Today people in Argentina can hold a variety of cryptos, which will be at their disposal no matter what happens to the banking system in their country. Not only do cryptos ensure that people have something they can trade with, but they also guarantee that the economy will continue to function. Centralized control over the banking and monetary system is generally accepted by people who live in countries like the United States, probably because they have never lived through a real financial crisis. It should come as no surprise that cryptos are catching on in Latin America, which has a long history of economic upheaval. Abstract terms used by economists serve to obfuscate the real engine of economic functionality; the people who work to produce useful goods and services. When a banking system collapses, people can’t trade easily. Centralized control over money and markets has a dark side, which few in the developed world are familiar with. Cryptos are a new way for people to connect with each other. Digital money doesn’t need to be stored in banks, nor do banks need to be involved in the settlement process. If the Argentine banking system collapses (again), the people there could still pay for transportation using BTC. The banks don’t matter with cryptos, which is why digital peer-to-peer platforms are such a radical change from the existing financial system. Cryptos could be even more important for larger financial institutions and corporations, in the event of a global banking crisis. At the end of the day, a corporation has to maximize shareholder value, regardless of what kind of money they use for trade settlement. Bitcoin might not be the perfect crypto to replace the global financial system, but it does have some amazing advantages over fiat money and centralized banking. As the century unfolds, we might see more people turning to cryptos as a currency of last resort.",

        "passage": "Earlier this week the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) announced that they have created a new “FinTech” license that allows blockchain or crypto companies to accept deposits of public money in the amount of $100 million Swiss Francs (CHF). The new FinTech license will be available starting in 2019, and has to be applied for. FINMA notes that this move has, “relaxed requirements,” for fintech firms, though some barriers still separate fintech firms from normal banks.  Unlike a bank, the new FinTech license from FINMA prohibits fintech firms from investing the public money they receive or paying interest on it. Most banks or corporations wouldn’t have these kinds of restrictions placed on them. Regardless, this new set of regulations shows that some countries are working toward creating a crypto friendly banking environment. The new FinTech license from FINMA is probably a direct result of fintech innovation from places outside of the banking sector. While still distinct from a regular bank, the new code that governs how the FinTech licensees will be granted references the Swiss Banking Act. FinTech companies that want to accept public funds will have to provide the Swiss regulators with information about their business, and how they plan to store any assets that they are entrusted with. Risk management, KYC and Anti-Money Laundering statutes will all apply to any company that receives a FinTech license in Switzerland, despite the fact they aren’t being given the same abilities that a bank would have.  Read: Bitcoin and Money Laundering: Complete Guide to Worldwide Regulations Switzerland has taken on moderate ground in the global crypto regulation arena. This most recent regulatory upgrade joins a few others from Swiss regulators, all of which seem to favour the cautious adoption of a liberal stance towards blockchain and digital assets. Many other influential nations haven’t been as quick to act on crypto regulations, except in the cases when they have been prohibited. China is perhaps the most notable example of a country that was fast to act to ban cryptos, once they became popular internationally. Cryptos have fallen into a strange legal area in the USA. They are currently being treated as a commodity for tax purposes, which has left some crypto traders in a lurch. Now it looks like there is a member of the US House of Representative that is trying to lock-down firmer regulations for an important global industry. Representative Warren Davidson (R) publicly revealed a bill that would create solid regulations for cryptocurrencies and ICOs earlier this week. According to Cleveland.com, Rep. Davidson announced that he will work to introduce his bill to the US House, at the Blockchain Solutions conference. The new bill would create an, “asset class,” for cryptos, and, “would prevent them from being classified as securities, but would also allow the federal government to regulate initial coin offerings more effectively.” As it stands today, the legislation for cryptos varies from state-to-state, and even within federal US Government regulatory bodies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies cryptos as securities, even though the Commodities and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) classifies them as commodities. Clearly, new legislation is needed in the world’s largest capital market. As cryptos grow more popular globally, nations that don’t give new businesses a sense of legal stability aren’t going to be as attractive for new investments. Rep. Davidson told media that ICO regulation would require, “light touch,” regulation. This may prove a hard sell in the USA, where numerous ICOs turned out to be total frauds. The ICO feeding frenzy that emerged as crypto prices exploded last year has left many people wondering about the ethics of the entire crypto community, and given regulators all the evidence they need to come down hard on one of the most innovative ways to raise capital in human history. Ultimately, countries will have to face strong competition in the international arena when it comes to crypto regulations, and nations that choose to overlook an emerging industry may face severe consequences down the road. A lack of access to what could be the next global capital market could be catastrophic for countries that resist crypto-based development, no matter how powerful governments and central banks may seem at the moment.",

        "passage": "Only one of the “big four” cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea managed to record a profit for the year 2018. This revelation is the latest in a long list of negative performance for companies in the crypto space after the year-long bear market of 2018. Throughout 2018, cryptocurrency prices slumped considerably, by as much as 80 percent across the board.  According to Business Korea, only Upbit among the big four cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea posted profit earnings for 2018. The other three platforms – Coinone, Korbit, and as previously reported by Blockonomi, Bithumb, all recorded losses in 2018. Financial disclosure documents published by Dunamu Inc., operators of Upbit, show the platform was able to make a net profit of 140 billion won ($123 million). The cryptocurrency exchange posted sales of 470 billion won ($413 million) with an operating profit of more than 287 billion won ($252 million). Upbit’s operating expenses for the year stood at 96.5 billion won ($84 million). In all, the company performed better than it did in 2107 with its profit margin rising by almost 100 percent. For the other three, the situation was the exact opposite. Coinone’s audit report shows the company’s net loss at 5.80 billion won ($5 million). Korbit’s net loss for 2018 was about 45.80 billion won ($40 million). Bithumb posted the biggest losses among the big four, with a net loss of 205 billion won ($180 million). The platform’s net loss was more than Korbit and Coinone combined. There is also the possibility that the $30 million hack suffered by Bithumb also contributed to the size of its loss. Less than a fortnight after the hack, the company did announce that it had managed to recover more than half of the stolen cryptocurrencies. Despite the bear market of 2018, the Kimchi premium still persisted for large swaths of the year. Traders in the country often had to pay a markup price for cryptocurrencies when compared to the market average price. However, not even the Kimchi premium was enough to prevent the huge losses incurred by these three platforms. For all three, sales figures declined massively in the second half of the year. The significant sales decline coupled with the devaluation of cryptocurrency prices as the bear market bit harder saw operating profits for these platforms begin to enter deficit region. Tightening government regulations also likely played a role in the poor sales figures for these major exchange platforms. The government outlawed anonymous cryptocurrency trading with probably led to a decline in the number of accounts for each exchange. Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone aren’t alone in counting the losses from the year-long bear market of 2018. Mining firms also shrinking revenue with a couple even abandoning plans for massive initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong. Bitmain is yet to release its financial report for the second half of 2018. There are reports that the company suffered devastating losses in Q3 and Q4 2018. Bitmain’s bet on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the subsequent hash war of November 2018 are likely to have caused massive hemorrhage in the company’s revenue. Nvidia, one of the world’s largest computer chip maker announced earlier in the year that it was departing the cryptocurrency business. The company hopes to offload its outstanding inventory given the shrinking demand for mining hardware.",

        "passage": "Bitcoin hasn’t had the best of weeks. Since Sunday, the cryptocurrency has fallen in price by more than 20%. Due to the sudden nature of this move, investors sought to figure out potential catalysts. As reported by Blockonomi, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of BitBull Capital, looked to the lackluster launch of Bakkt coupled with a rapid drop in Bitcoin’s hash rate, which saw the metric fall from just shy of 100 exahashes per second to 67 in a spectacular fashion.  According to one analyst, however, the correlation drawn between the hash rate and Bitcoin’s day-to-day value is categorically wrong. What’s more, he suggests that the Bitcoin “hashcrash”, as some have dubbed the seeming collapse in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, may have never taken place. When nearly half of Bitcoin’s hash rate — a metric used to describe the level of computational power backing the network and processing BTC transactions — seemingly disappeared overnight, investors were  quick to express their concerns on online forums. Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer noted that this trend looks “very unhealthy”, before going on to bash the seeming shortcomings of Bitcoin’s Proof of Work system and its relation to exchange security.  Others simply pointed to the fact that if the metric was real, it meant that a massive amount of cryptocurrency mining infrastructure — farms worth dozens of millions of dollars — were suddenly shut down, implying a decrease in interest in BTC. Trade publications quickly picked up on this story, spreading a sense of uncertainty throughout the industry. However, Sasha Fleyshman, a trader at crypto investment firm Arca, recently came out to remark that this flash crash in Bitcoin’s hash rate is likely a misnomer. He broke down his findings and analysis of the odd debacle in an extensive Twitter thread, which he summed up as a way to debunk the “FUD fuel” that was the hashcrash.  Firstly, he noted that there is unlikely one mining farm or entity that has access to 40% of the network, let alone enough access to shutdown thousands of mining machines for an entire day. And even if one entity had such leverage, what would be the point? To lose tens of thousands of dollars worth of potential profits, to stave off a large mining difficulty adjustment, or to slow down block times for a few days? No, likely not. Fleyshman then explained that the way in which hash rate is calculated by many metric providers is inherently susceptible to anomalies, which is a byproduct of Bitcoin not inherently calculating the extent of the computational power securing its network. The Arca trader made reference to a Twitter thread by the founder of blockchain startup Summa, which outlined that an irregular 18-minute block is likely the anomaly behind the -35% reading for Bitcoin’s hash rate on some metrics providers. He suggested that due to the way in which Bitcoin’s hash rate is estimated, a single 18-minute block may have had an outsized effect on the calculations, leading to the harrowing reading. While the steep dropoff in Bitcoin mining activity shocked investors, all is now well. The hash rate of the leading blockchain network is now edging closer to 100 exahashes per second once again, and is, according to Hans Hauge of Ikigai, a key sign that Bitcoin is fundamentally stronger than ever and not in a bear market.

        "passage": "Canada’s flag carrier Air Canada has signed an agreement with Swiss start-up Winding Tree to participate in a blockchain-based open source travel platform. The letter of intent signed by Air Canada with Winding Tree is expected to remove bottlenecks associated with the distribution and sale of air travel products. The Swiss start-up will be saddled with the responsibility of addressing the malady through the development of an open-source platform for travel distribution so as to ensure customers can have  better access to inventories directly from the airline.  Director of Global Product Distribution for Air Canada Keith Wallis expressed enthusiasm in the foresight shown by the management in leveraging the next generation technology for more efficient service delivery. Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Winding Tree Pedro Anderson commended Canada Airline for being a front-runner in the integration of such an innovative technology into its operations. “As the first North American carrier to work with Winding Tree’s public blockchain platform, Air Canada is showing itself to be a real leader in innovation,” he noted. Founded in 1937, Air Canada boasts of the largest fleet size and volume of passengers making it the largest airline in Canada. Its outreach as a charter air transport caters to passengers and cargo in 207 destinations across the globe. The company celebrated its 80th-anniversary last year with the launch of a red and black aircraft livery. With services spanning over 220 airports on six continents, Canada’s flag carrier ranks among the top 20 largest airlines in the world. Winding Tree started in 2017 as a blockchain-based, decentralized, open-source travel distribution platform with the objective of providing cheap traveling logistics for consumers while ensuring suppliers also maximize their returns. Its operation of an open competition helps to eliminate the barriers that might be encountered by new entrants in the airline industry. The company also caters to consumers by eliminating exorbitant transaction fees that could increase the cost of travel. Its innovative services promote an enabling environment for small companies to thrive with big players in the travel industry. The integration of blockchain technology in the operational processes of airline companies is becoming a trend adopted by players in the industry. Earlier this month, Air France KLM took the necessary step to enhance the integration of Blockchain Technology into the travel industry. The advancement was aimed at improving the supply chain and logistics in a way that provides affordable travel offerings to customers and increased profitability for suppliers. With the Blockchain technology, the number of intermediaries is drastically reduced, and users can have a more direct access to the airlines. Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) also partnered with TravelbyBit in August 2018, to introduce blockchain enabled payments for shopping activities in its terminals. Shops and stores such as Botanist, Windmill & Co., Spoon, and Fort Espresso will benefit immensely from the innovative system which has now enabled customers to make payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash among other digital currencies. The partnership consolidated the aim of Brisbane Airport to provide an enabling environment for community projects, local businesses, and passenger experience. While speaking, Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) General Manager Strategic Planning and Development Roel Hellemons said, “Many people around the world have made money investing in cryptocurrencies, and a lot of these people travel internationally, so it makes sense to offer a digital currency experience within our terminals.” Disclosing plans to expand the usage of cryptocurrencies, he stated, “This is just the beginning for us as we hope to expand the digital currency options across the business, so watch the space. “",

        "passage": "Blockchain development costs aren’t cheap. Singapore-based company Morpheus Labs thinks that their Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform could help blockchain adoption to spread. The company has developed a platform that can help companies who want to create blockchain-based solutions, and it has been getting a lot of attention recently. Anything that leverages blockchain’s potential to create efficiency is probably going to be a good place to be. The blockchain industry is projected to grow into a $20 billion+ USD industry by 2023, which is a compound annual growth rate of 80%. That may be why Morpheus Labs has been cementing partnerships with a wide range of companies, as well as some big names in the education space.  So far Morpheus Labs has created working relationships with NULS, VeChain, QuarkChain, NeuroChain Tech and NEM, among others. The company’s tie-up with VeChain is especially interesting, as it is working to create enterprise-level blockchain applications that could be scaled up to take on the jobs that bigger companies like IBM have been able to land. IBM is currently using their version of Hyperledger to replace numerous archaic information systems. One of the most prominent is the IBM Food Trust, which is being onboarded by Walmart to keep track of its leafy green veggy supply chain. The implications for the platform are enormous, and it is possible that IBM will solidify a first-mover advantage in the blockchain space because of their existing assets and connections. Morpheus Labs CEO Chuang Pei-Han commented to Forbes that, The idea that a company could access ready-made blockchain architecture that could be adapted to their needs turns the current blockchain development space upside down. Instead of having to contract bespoke blockchain development services, companies could get blockchain working for them, with a minimum amount of money spent. Having open access to inexpensive blockchain architecture also opens up the field for new ideas, which don’t need millions of dollars to bring into beta testing. Blockchain has been an esoteric development space, but that seems to be changing. Morpheus Labs is also working with universities to create more blockchain developers. The company recently welcomed EMBA students and researchers from Tsinghua University and National Taiwan Normal University. Tsinghua University also has formal connections with Ripple Labs, another company that is looking to grow the blockchain space via expanded education options. Pei-Han commented that, “The key to a good partnership is not always looking at surface level value. Strategic planning and outlook help pick the right long-term partner. The basis of a partnership should always complement each company in term of needs,” in the same Forbes article. At this point, the blockchain development space is just coming into its own. Companies like Morpheus Labs are important to the blockchain space, as they give SMEs more options for how they can develop blockchain platforms. As prices for blockchain development drop, the industry is likely to feed on its own success in a virtuous cycle. The major question then pivots to cryptos, and how they will fit into the new blockchain-based record keeping systems. Companies like PowerLedger have demonstrated how powerful blockchain can be in alternative energy systems, but they require that transactions are settled outside of the established financial system. In order for blockchain to deliver maximum efficiency, it is likely that the existing financial system, with fiat currency included, is replaced by a currency that allows blockchain to deliver the cost savings it is capable of creating.",

        "passage": "Tech powerhouse Microsoft announced its latest contribution the Decentralized Identity Foundation on May 13th, and it was a big one: the enterprise released a preview of its new ION tool, a decentralized identity (DID) service built on top of the Bitcoin network.  Alex Simons, VP of Program Management, Microsoft Identity Division, noted that the tool, which has been characterized by its builders as “open public infrastructure,” had achieved the performance capabilities necessary to power worldwide usage: And why DID, then? For the sake of user empowerment, particularly with regard to privacy. Centralized identity mechanisms (e.g. account logins) have proven fragmentary, meaning users have had to trust their login info with disparate sources — some easier to compromise than others.  Yet ION is a developing stab toward leveraging encryption and Bitcoin to give users secure and self-owned ID, Simons said: For its part, Microsoft has been making increasing overtures to the realm of decentralized identity — which Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin recently told Elon Musk was solvable by blockchain tech — as of late. The company joined the ID2020 initiative last year, an effort focused on making blockchain-based ID systems a reality. Earlier this month, Microsoft partnered with banking giant JP Morgan on a deal that saw Morgan’s private fork of Ethereum, Quorum, as the first blockchain project available to build on via the Azure Blockchain Service, which Microsoft launched on May 2nd. That collaboration will make it easier for enterprise clients to build apps with Quorum. Likewise, on May 6th, Microsoft announced it was releasing a preview of an Ethereum development suite — the Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum — which offered a selection of relevant tools for builders. In April, Microsoft sponsored the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon, which saw hackers and entrepreneurs racing to build Ethereum-based projects for prizes. The company also joined the Token Taxonomy Initiative, which is seeking to coordinate tokenization standards across multiple public blockchain projects.  The venture capital wing of Microsoft, M12, also participated in a $182 million USD funding round for the high-profile forthcoming crypto exchange and futures platform, Bakkt, earlier this year. Taken altogether, the array of moves indicates Microsoft is doing much more than just its homework on the cryptoeconomy — the company is taking an active role in the space and positioning itself as an emissary to welcome other major institutions and enterprise into the crypto fold. Microsoft’s release of its ION preview was just one of a few big adoption headlines hitting the cryptoverse on May 13th. One such headline centered around the virtual marketplace eBay, as ads saying “Virtual currency. It’s happening on eBay” appeared on the premises of the Consensus conference during the event’s first day. Another thread that hit the fore on the 13th was a partnership between the crypto exchange Gemini and crypto network Flexa in a deal that will see major retailers like Nordstrom and GameStop accepting digital assets as a payments option going forward. Not bad for a Monday, right?",

        "passage": "Coinbase, the United States’ most popular exchange, has temporarily halted support for Ethereum Classic transactions, deposits, and withdrawals due to a 51 percent attack on Sunday, reports CoinDesk. The attack was made public via The Coinbase Blog this Monday. There, security engineer Mark Nesbitt started the post with a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper: For any proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, the honest approval of half of the miners (nodes) is required to alter the blockchain – otherwise known as validating a transaction. Ideally, that half would always have an opinion that benefits the blockchain, but that isn’t always the case.  Should 51 percent of nodes be taken over, the system will fall under attack: According to the post, this process is called a “chain reorganization.” Each one has “depth” which means the number of blocks that were replaced. Then, it has a “length” which is how many blocks replaced the previous ones. What Ethereum Classic suffered from was this, resulting in what is called a “double-spend attack” – when a digital token is spent more than once. It is duplicated, in a sense. The value of this attack seems to be 88,500 ETC ($460,000) reads the Coinbase Blog. This was the result of over 100 blocks being “reorganized.” The information has been validated by Bitfly and Blockscout – block explorers monitoring the blockchain. Also, Coiness reported on one of their analysts finding an “abnormal hash rate” heading into one mining pool, which was the first sign of the attack. SlowMist, a security company from China, had made the attack public on Monday morning and revealed their attempts to track it. When discussing their next steps, Nesbitt ended the post with: No one can agree on the length of the attack, however. Blockscout reported reorganization at 02:00 UTC and 05:00 UTC this Monday. However, at 17:00 UTC, Bitfly stated that the attack could be ongoing, which the Coinbase post echoed. As revealed via CoinDesk, Blockscout project lead Andrew Cravenho claimed that the Ethereum Classic network is “fluctuating and people are always switching their hashing power.” Cravenho’s explanation isn’t universally accepted, however. In an e-mail to Coindesk, Ethereum Classic advisor Cody Burns believes the attack was more of a “selfish mining” put in place by a “client-local phenomenon.” Then, Burns tweeted that “the entire Ethereum network doesn’t ‘reorganize’ simultaneously. It would be more likely that someone discovered all of Coinbase ETC nodes and ‘surrounded’ them.” Regardless of the reasons behind the attack, companies working with Ethereum Classic should do whatever they can to protect their user base. The official Ethereum Classic Twitter account stated that the crypto mining hardware manufacturer Linzhi could be the culprit. Allegedly, the group was testing new machines with a 1,400mH/s hash rate. Yet, a director of operations Wolfgang Spraul claimed:",

That reality is not lost on many cryptoeconomy stakeholders, particularly blockchain analysis firms like CipherTrace and Chainalysis — companies that have proven increasingly ascendant as exchanges and governments have sought to better understand cryptoeconomy transaction flows.  Yet is that ascendancy on the verge of an existential challenge? It’s a question some in the space are mulling after a curious “Ask Me Anything” thread appeared in r/Bitcoin earlier this week before being promptly deleted. The AMA was held by a person purporting to be a “current or former employee of Chainalysis.” It’s unclear whether the user, dubbed Chainalysis1, was able to verify their identity with the subreddit’s moderators beyond a shadow of a doubt. It’s also unclear why they ultimately deleted the thread. With that said, their alleged insider knowledge should be approached with the appropriate level of skepticism, all things considered. Notably, before the thread’s deletion the purported employee answered several questions with answers suggesting the advance of cryptocurrency privacy tech was a devastating gamechanger for the blockchain analysis industry. And while the chance remains the AMA was an elaborate stunt, many of the answers were thought-provoking enough to be worth considering beyond the thread’s direct context. One user asked Chainalysis1 if their alleged employer would be able to weather the advance of privacy solutions like the Wasabi wallet, which leverages the CoinJoin mixing technique and multisig scripts to help users trustlessly hide their bitcoin’s origins among one another. “Things like that destroy the need for our/their software,” the purported employee answered, later adding: Asked by another Redditor what the firm’s “most hated tool” at present was, Chainalsysi1 specifically cited Wasabi wallet: Those are bold assertions, but they’re not necessarily ones that would take diehard cryptoverse privacy advocates by surprise. Rather, what is surprising is that these assertions come from someone claiming to have inside knowledge of one of the ecosystem’s top blockchain analysis firms. When asked later why they were conducting the AMA given the alleged circumstances, Chainalysis1 said “Transparency,” going on to say that such firms were unethical for “Defeating the purpose of a system that was designed for anonymity, thereby reducing the interest and market for crypto.” Yet not long after the thread went up, it went down — a version of its page is now only reachable via webpage archiving. To be sure, privacy coins like Monero already pose challenges for sleuths and regulators, while it’s becoming easier to use top public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum privately. Using Wasabi wallet in conjunction with Tor goes a long way toward making BTC transaction flows obscured, while Ethereum has recently seen major enterprises develop privacy tools for its public chain, e.g. EY’s Nightfall protocol and JP Morgan’s Anonymous Zether. Those dynamics alone indicate blockchain analysis firms have their work cut out for them in the years ahead.",

        "passage": "A local Jersey investor has been scammed of his life savings to the tune of $1.5 million, per reports from the Jersey Evening Post. According to the post, the man- whose name wasn’t provided- was promised as much as 1500 percent returns on his investment. Such returns, given his investment, would have made him a killing. Of course, it’s understandable that he would have fallen for such a scam.   According to the post, the man was scammed over an 18-month period, being gradually milked out of his entire life savings. However, while substantial crypto scams such as this are definitely not news, one thing that seems to distinguish this case from a host of others like it is that the victim, in particular, was said to be an “experienced” investor. The fact that he was swindled out of $1.5 million in a scam, even with all of his experience, is certainly ironic. You’d think that an experienced investor would recognize the qualities of a scam (such as the overly high rate of returns in this case). However, it is also possible that skilled con artists could find a way to work around the safeguards that experience could have instituted in the minds of investors as well.  The victim was reportedly contacted by the scammers after he went online to find out more about Bitcoin. The organization claimed to be operating out of Norwegian territory, although investigators later found evidence of them moving money across various banks all over the world. The scammers tricked this victim into believing that they were offering legitimate Bitcoin-based investments, and over the aforementioned time frame, they continued to trick him into making additional investments.  To add further anguish, investigators from the U.K.’s National Crime Agency reported that there is a slim chance that they will recover the funds he lost. The publication noted that a report on the scam was issued by the Jersey Fraud Prevention Forum the forum encouraged locals of the island to be increasingly vigilant as regards cryptocurrency scams; especially any which might promise excessively high returns.  Mike Jones, the Director of Policy and Risk at the Jersey Financial Services Commission, said, “Following this Islander’s huge loss, we are warning local residents to be extra vigilant when investing in cryptocurrencies or any investment that seems too good to be true and promises high returns with no risk. Always get independent advice from a professional, and make sure the company you’re dealing with is legitimate.” Last month, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) issued a warning to existing and potential crypto investors, encouraging them to be more vigilant in their choice of investment schemes.  In a press release published on April 24, both agencies stated that they’ve come to recognize the rise of crypto scams in which con artists disguise as legitimate cryptocurrency trading businesses and advisory firms, and go on to receive funds from unsuspecting investors with the prospect of investing in crypto-related businesses.  In the release, the watchdogs provided six prominent red flags for illegitimate investment schemes, further encouraging investors to conduct the proper due diligence on any potential investment scheme before releasing funds to it. The red flags included guaranteed high investment returns, unsolicited offers, jargon-filled documents, and overly complicated terms, continued pressure to invest as soon as possible, and the terms of the deal sounding too good to be true. Both agencies concluded by urging potential crypto investors to check the Investor.gov site to look up the license of any investment operators in the government database. Any vestment that isn’t registered and listed on here is most likely a scam.",

        "passage": "The institution saddled with the responsibility of supplying the United Kingdom’s coinage, Royal Mint Limited has ditched plans to launch a gold-backed cryptocurrency as a result of the government’s decision to veto the project, according to a Reuters report. The project has been in the pipeline since 2016 as the Royal Mint had contemplated issuing “Royal Mint Gold” (RMG) tokens, worth as much as $1 billion backed by gold assets in the Mint’s vaults. American based commodity derivative exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was to serve as the blockchain platform on which RMG would be traded.  The digital gold currency was meant to be backed by gold reserves and at the time, it was expected to change the way “traders and investors trade, execute and settle gold,” according to its press release. Observers anticipated the rollout of RMG before the end of 2017 following an official collaboration between CME Group and the Royal Mint to develop the bullion product.  CME posted on its website, at the time, that it was working with blockchain security company BitGo to come up with a “fast, cost-effective and cryptographically secure method” of purchasing, retaining and transacting the precious mineral. Financial institutions opened their systems to the RMG trading platform as they expected its formal operation by the end of the year. The Royal Mint also made known on its website that the tokens would serve as an alternative way to invest in trade and physical gold. It aims to provide the investment performance of the London Gold Market with the transparency of an exchange-traded asset.  The launch was postponed till 2018, but things went awry following the indifference of CME to make the project a reality.  “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved;” an anonymous source from Royal Mint disclosed in the report. The sudden display of apathy from CME was allegedly owing to the shift in priorities away from digital assets – a policy change caused by the retirements of CEO Phupinder Gill and head of digitization Sandra Ro in 2018.  Thus, enthusiasm towards digital assets gradually waned. In 2017, CME joined the league of companies that launched bitcoin futures trading on their respective platforms. This includes a number of other digital asset startups which the company has invested in. Amidst the sluggish trading activity during the third trade quarter of 2017, the firm reported $904.2 million worth of revenue – a stark contrast to $890.8 million reported in the same period of 2016. The company’s new Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy attributed the growth to the company’s strength in interest rate, equities, and metal product lines. Contrary to the position of Royal Mint on the botched deal, CME denied any form of negligence on its path. “It is not correct to say we have de-emphasized’ digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy,” a source said. Consequent upon the exit of CME, Royal Mint made efforts to bring the project back to light by entering into a partnership with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange. The plans were, however, scuttled by the finance ministry of the United Kingdom.  All hopes might, however, not be lost yet as the Royal Mint looks forward to giving it a shot in the nearest future. “We will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” a source disclosed to the agency.",

        "passage": "Most bitcoin naysayers come from the world of traditional finance – banks, venture capital, and so on. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has now joined them with the claim that bitcoin is like Napster, a necessary and transformative failure. Naturally, he thinks his company’s XRP coin is superior, but is he right, or is he just pumping his own cryptocurrency?  Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO. Image from Coinstaker.com When Napster was created, it was not initially intended to be a business. Instead, it was a tool that would eventually give birth to the various peer-to-peer and filesharing networks that are omnipresent today. For those that don’t remember or were too young to experience it, Napster was a piece of software that allowed anyone to share and download MP3 files, regardless of copyright. This allowed for the instant and free distribution of copyrighted music to anyone and everyone in the world in a largely anonymous way.  Napster as it looked in 2001, Image from Archive.org Napster did not operate forever, however, and was eventually shut down due to pressure from the music industry. The legacy of Napster still lives on as consumer’s relations with the music industry have shifted significantly, and the expectation of needing to buy a $20 CD in order to get music are now effectively gone forever. For a brief time Napster was brought back as a legally compliant paid music service, but it died quickly. This is what Ripple CEO Garlinghouse thinks of bitcoin. That while the technology is essential and transformative, it will eventually die due to failing to be “engaged with regulators to solve a real problem” According to Garlinghouse, Ripple’s XRP is not only superior to bitcoin due to its supposed compliance with regulators (despite being sued for securities fraud earlier this year), but that it is also somehow financially or technologically superior. Garlinghouse cites the classic example of buying coffee with bitcoin. According to him, bitcoin transactions take 20 minutes to complete, and the transaction fee would double the cost of buying coffee. Clearly, Garlinghouse is not familiar with SegWit and Lightning Network. Both of these technologies allow for significantly cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions. Additionally, while a bitcoin transaction could take several minutes to confirm, that does not mean it takes 20 minutes to appear on the blockchain and be a reliable indicator of funds sent. During a speech given at MIT, famed bitcoin commentator Andreas Antonopoulos spoke on the true nature of bitcoin confirmations, saying: In other words, stores could very reasonably sell someone a cup of coffee at zero confirmations. That means just a few seconds is all that’s needed, not “20 minutes”. Things get even more impressive when Lightning Network is involved. Specifically when using the technology, transactions complete in just a few seconds and cost less than a penny. Let’s compare the usefulness of Ripple’s XRP coin compared to bitcoin. Today, bitcoin can be used directly to make myriad of different sorts of purchases. Bitcoin can even be used to directly purchase gold and silver. Bitcoin is by far the most commonly accepted cryptocurrency around the world, and also the most available in terms of exchange support, online purchase with fiat currency, and with the sheer number of compatible ATM devices worldwide.  Ripple, Worth the Hype ? Now let’s look at Ripple. Its XRP coin which was primarily created to facilitate bank-to-bank payments has so far never been used by a single bank, ever. The number of stores or businesses that accept Ripple as a payment is trivial compared to bitcoin, and the same can be said for the number of exchanges like Coinbase that would sell it directly for fiat currency. Further, only a small handful of ATM devices sell Ripple directly. Just in terms of adoption, bitcoin is light-years ahead of Ripple. Further, the primary goal of Ripple’s XRP coin, to be used by banks, has still never happened and no bank has announced even a tiny degree of intent or interest to use XRP for anything whatsoever. Ripple has only managed to sell other technologies they have created and that are unrelated to cryptocurrency. Back in January the company said they were doing a trial with MoneyGram (not a bank) but the public has yet to hear whether or not this led to a real world partnership. Another significant point to mention about Ripple and its XRP coin is that it is completely dominated by the Ripple company itself. Ripple the company and its employees and advisers are sitting on billions of XRP coins. Ripple is a centralized company, with a centralized network, and a largely centralized blockchain. Compare this to bitcoin. No individual company controls bitcoin or its issuance. It’s network is much more decentralized than Ripple’s, and bitcoin transactions are mined and processed all over the globe. Because of the wide support of miners, bitcoin is also arguably the most secure cryptocurrency on earth. The most important point here is that while there are billions of XRP coins locked up and waiting to flood the market, bitcoin is under no such artificial controls or restrictions. One of the main points of cryptocurrency is that there should be no central authority manipulating the supply. With Ripple and its XRP coins, there is a central authority, and they have almost unlimited power in terms of their potential for manipulating the supply of bitcoin on the market. Ripple and its XRP coin may appear to be very promising to a number of investors. However, we must remember that XRP coins simply aren’t being used for much of anything besides investor speculation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is already out there every day processing real-world transactions and payments. The technology still has a long way to go in order to continue scaling, but this is happening with each passing day. The XRP coin, on the other hand, is the Ripple corporations attempt to put a suit and tie on cryptocurrency. But so far, no major bank seems interested. And so, when Ripple CEO Garlinghouse says that Ripple is in every way superior, we would ask that he not just make wild claims, but instead prove them.",

        "passage": "Coinbase wants you to keep your crypto holdings safe, but they also want you to have access to the funds, even if you lose your mobile device. According to its latest announcement, Coinbase users can now back up their Wallet’s private keys to their cloud storage accounts, including Google Drive or iCloud. The new initiative will provide a safeguard for users, where they end up losing their funds because they misplaced their private keys.  The post from the exchange reads:  Up until now, Coinbase users have had to store their private keys on their mobile device, which provided the only way to access their cryptocurrencies. This created a problem as losing Coinbase ‘user-controlled wallets’ or failing to back up the recovery phrase meant losing the funds forever. With the new cloud backup feature, the exchange will make the encrypted version of the private keys available to all users allowing them to keep their funds safe irrespective of what happens to their device. Per the blog post, the private keys will be encrypted with “AES-256-GCM encryption” and stored on the cloud account, but it can only be accessed with the Coinbase Wallet mobile app, while the private keys can only be decrypted using the user’s chosen password. In cases, where the user loses access to their device, they can quickly recover their funds by using a combination of a password, which they would decide, and their iCloud or Google Drive accounts. The Cloud feature is an addition to the current security features on Coinbase Wallet. The exchange’s users will still have the option to view and store their 12-word recovery phrase and back it up manually. The announcement from Coinbase has generated a backlash from the crypto community who have always warned against the risks associated with storing sensitive data on the cloud, which has been riddled with poor data management and a plethora of SIM Swapping hacks, which has been on the increase of late.  CEO of U.S. exchange Kraken Jesse Powell was quick to criticize Coinbase’s decision to provide a cloud storing feature for user’s private keys, saying it would cause more problems than solve the existing ones. He stated on Twitter: “I am not a fan of training users on bad security. Cloud storage, while convenient, is constantly compromised, especially with all the SIM porting. 99% chance the people who would unwittingly use this do not have passwords strong enough to withstand professional cracking. #SFYL”  Earlier this month, a 20-year old SIM-Swap crypto thief was indicted from stealing cryptocurrencies from over 50 victims in the U.S. According to the office of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, Dawson Bakies, a resident of Ohio, stole the identities and the crypto funds of his victims using a SIM-Swapping attack by fraudulently linking his victim’s cell phone numbers to multiple iPhones controlled by him.",

        "passage": "A new report issued by the New York Attorney General’s office states that cryptocurrency exchanges are subject to poor surveillance tactics and conflicts of interest, making them more prone to manipulation and privacy breaches.  Manipulation in the cryptocurrency market seems to be a running theme. A few months ago, University of Texas finance professor John Griffin released a document stating that bitcoin’s price swell during 2017 was the result of manipulation by investors who were tying the currency to Tether, an alleged stable coin backed by USD. The report suggests that every time bitcoin’s price dropped in 2017 by even a marginal amount, the group would use Tether to purchase bitcoin, thereby tying it to U.S. dollar reserves and causing further spikes in its price. Though executives of the stable coin state they’ve done no wrong, the report alleges that the maneuvers were first-class manipulation tactics and has, in turn, caused organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to step in and investigate. A company audit of Tether has potentially confirmed that the purported manipulation did not take place, and even Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has taken a stance, siding with Tether and rejecting Griffin’s claims. Whether such a move really took place remains to be seen. However, the subject of manipulation has often been a large – and recurring – theme in the cryptocurrency arena, and now it’s making its way back into news forums. The latest report from the Attorney General’s office of New York explains that online platforms where cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be bought and sold by individual customers do not have the same level of security as traditional banks or other establishments that house assets like precious metals. Thus, market manipulation is a constant threat, as is the risk of customer information falling into the wrong hands. Attorney General Barbara Underwood explains: The organization is now looking into whether three specific cryptocurrency exchanges might be operating illegally within the Big Apple. These platforms include Binance, Kraken and Gate.io. All three have been under the Attorney General’s observation since April of this year after they refused to participate in the office’s Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, in which 13 specific digital exchanges operating in New York were asked to share information regarding the safety of their practices. For the past five months, the three exchanges in question have not cooperated with Underwood or her team. Some of the information in the report details how various exchanges can often overlap certain lines of business. These include executives trading for their own accounts on their own venues, thereby representing serious conflicts of interest per the report’s verbiage. In addition, several exchanges often issue their own unique tokens or even charge companies that seek to list those tokens. Furthermore, the document says that while some platforms do police their markets for abuse, many others do not, and that: Thus, the report deems that it’s either “difficult or impossible” to confirm that exchanges are exercising appropriate means of responsibility when it comes to holding customer accounts and keeping their funds safe. It further states:",

        "passage": "Like many tech-focused industries, crypto is full of scammers. Due to the pseudonymous, digital, and private nature of the technologies that back cryptocurrencies, many bad actors have tried and leverage this asset class to make a quick buck, or Bitcoin satoshi if you will. Unfortunately, many of these scammers have succeeded in their schemes, managing to swindle industry investors out of millions in digital assets, from Bitcoin to Ripple’s XRP. But, a prominent industry Youtuber and marketing guru recently flipped the tables on a scammer, outplaying him/her.  Oh, how the tables have turned. Ben Perrin, the host of BTC Sessions, a Youtube channel focused on Bitcoin education followed by 30,000 and watched by many more, recently took to CBC to tell his story about an odd run-in with an industry scammer. Earlier this week, a scammer messaged Perrin on Instagram, promising to double his Bitcoin investment within a short period of time. This tactic is quite common, especially on Instagram, where DMs can come unsolicited and often aren’t properly screened/censored by the platform. Perrin, who has been involved in the industry for years now, immediately identified the “offer” as a scam, as it is obviously too good to be true. But, he decided to “play along”, expressing fake interest in the Bitcoin investment opportunity. In fact, he went as far as to claim he wanted to send $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to the individual, creating a fake wallet and building a false narrative. The scammer, who was likely then giddy to “steal” Perrin’s $20,000 in Bitcoin, even agreed to pay $50 to the educator to prove the “offer’s” legitimacy.  Perrin took the $50, called out the scammer, then donated the small sum to charity. His charity of choice was Bitcoin Venezuela, a BTC-centric non-profit centered on helping Venezuelans adopt the cryptocurrency as the local currency continues to inflate at a jaw-dropping pace. Funnily enough, a policeman from Calgary, Canada’s economic crime unit explained that Perrin’s approach was actually dangerous: Despite the positive story, scams are still rampant in the crypto space. Just the other day, prominent Chinese cryptocurrency venture capitalist Dovey Wan wrote that EtherDelta, one of the most prominent Ethereum decentralized exchanges, is reportedly involved in a “major scam in China”. She wrote that the scam involved the issuance of an EtherDelta Token (EDT), which turned out to be a way for the owners of the exchange to exit scam.  It is still unclear how much the owners of EtherDelta, which are unnamed Chinese investors, managed to make away with. However, there is purportedly a group of “furious investors” ringing up local police to try and spawn an investigation. This would mark one of the latest in a line of countless Chinese crypto scams. As reported by Blockonomi earlier this year, a group used the Chinese translation of “Tron” and a promise of massive capital gains to trick a group of investors into purportedly giving up $30 million. The scheme’s tactics were so damaging that local media reports that a single mother killed herself over the lost funds, which she borrowed from a neighbor and was unable to pay back. Also, there have been rumors of scams invoking the name of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in places like Australia, India, and even the U.S.",

        "passage": "It is difficult to think of a better market for blockchain than online freelancing. Today some estimate the amount earned by online freelance professionals at nearly 2 trillion dollars. Regardless of the exact amount, the space has grown substantial over the last decade. Platforms like UpWork and Freelancer are currently in the top spots, but blockchain could change all that over the next few years. There are issues for online freelancers that blockchain could easily address. Making sure that payment is secure for a freelancer is sometimes problematic. There are sites like UpWork that will hold money in escrow, but this is expensive, and isn’t a perfect system.  Blockchain can also help freelancers to build up a solid reputation, that doesn’t rely on a third-party website to verify their credentials. There are numerous ways that a person can defraud a client, and claim responsibility for work they never did. Blockchain can create a secure record of authorship, so that clients know they are hiring a professional that can get the job done. Zoom is on the cusp of releasing a blockchain-based freelancing platform that would tap into the potential that DLT tech could bring to a massive market. They are working on a platform that could replace a site like UpWork, and offer additional benefits as well. Zoom would use smart-contracts to make sure that freelancers would get paid, but they would also use blockchain to match freelancers with potentially perfect jobs. Zoom CEO, Plamen Nedyalkovis, commented to Venture Beat on the benefits that his company would offer in the payment space: Clients would also benefit from using Zoom. The platform was created with multi-party projects in mind, and allows numerous groups to participate in forming a single entity to manage a complex workflow. They would also benefit from the skills-matching feature of the platform, as clients would be saved from sorting through piles of talent. Moonlighting is another freelancing platform that is embracing blockchain. While Moonlighting is still a relatively small company when compared to UpWork or Freelancer, they have grown significantly since they launched in 2014. They are working on a new round of fundraising, and plan to use some of the proceeds to integrate blockchain into their already successful platform. Jeff Tennery, one of the founders of Moonlighting, had this to say about the capital raise: Many of the people that have entered both the online freelancing and blockchain space are passionate about what they do. It is easy to see that Jeff Tennery is probably sees a value in Moonlighting that is more than financial. Many in the blockchain space have similar feelings, and are looking for new ways to organize social structures. No matter how they are employed, smart-contracts are a great tool for online freelancing. Some freelancers may prefer to work through an organized system, like the one that Zoom or Moonlighting is developing, while others could find that a platform that allows smart-contacts to be drafted easily is a better fit. It is likely that the same advantages that blockchain offers other industries will be realized in freelancing. Unlike banking and FinTech, start-ups like Zoom have far fewer regulatory hurdles to overcome. Sites like UpWork may want to keep an eye on blockchain-based freelancing technology, as they will have to compete with these platforms once they are operational.",

        "passage": "Cryptocurrencies aren’t without their flaws. Bitcoin, for instance, once suffered a devastating bug that temporarily shut down its blockchain. Stellar Lumens (XLM) recently joined the list of blockchain projects that were rocked by a bug, with a leading industry data provider revealing that millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency were quietly injected into the Stellar ecosystem early in 2017.  In its ongoing quest to offer the crypto community high-quality data, the New York-based Messari has revealed that per its research, 2.25 billion XLM was generated out of thin air during April 2017. The funny thing is, barely anyone knew about this debacle prior to Messari’s recent report. According to the research, the cryptocurrency was generated by an unknown attacker who utilized the “MereOPFrame::doApply” function in Stellar’s protocol, which was once bugged. While the public details about how the bug was harnessed are scant, the economic effect of the sudden attack is known. Messari writes that the tokens created were worth $10 million at the time, and represented upwards of 25% of all circulating XLM at the time. And interestingly, Stellar’s developers were purportedly unable to catch the attacker’s wallets in time, as the data provider explains that the 2.25 billion XLM injection was likely distributed to exchange wallets and subsequently sold during the first half of 2017. Per a comment from the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), action has since been taken to mitigate further debacles. The SDF burnt Lumens from its development war chest to “true up” the supply, specifically in a bid to ensure that XLM holders wouldn’t see a dilution of their holdings. The organization’s representatives added that “Stellar has since become significant financial software,” forcing the SDF’s hand to improve its transparency protocols, which will go live by the end of 2019. Stellar may have recently come under fire due to this news, but this is far from the first inflation bug in the cryptocurrency industry’s short history. During the mid-2018 creation of Bitcoin Private, which forked from both the Bitcoin and ZClassic chains, there were 102 suspicious blocks that contained 400 expected outputs apiece. These outputs, according to Coinmetrics, collectively contained 2,040,000 BTCP that was printed out of thin air, and subsequently routed to shielded addresses. While it is unclear who executed this clever attack, the executor was estimated to have made away with at least $1 million to $3 million. Even Bitcoin (yes, the Bitcoin) once saw more supply than it bargained for. During block 74638, mined on August 15th, 2010, 184 billion BTC was created, which totally decimated Bitcoin’s long-standing 21 million supply limit. Somehow, a user managed to create a transaction with a negative value, creating an integer overflow that spawned the billions of BTC. In this case, Gavin Andresen and the fabled Satoshi Nakamoto got to work near-immediately, purging the block from existence. While none of the 184 billion BTC ever made it to an exchange, third-party, or a user not complicit in the attack, the fact remains that cryptocurrencies, even the leading one, are far from infallible. In spite of all this, the SDF seems entirely unfazed by its inflation-ridden past. And maybe, that’s for good reason. Since April 2017, the project has skyrocketed to crypto fame, becoming one of the highest valued cryptocurrencies in existence. Whether this is due to its countless partnerships with IBM, its viability as a smart contracting platform, or other developments, Blockonomi isn’t too sure. But the SDF is looking to continue the Stellar Blockchain’s success with a recent announcement. On Tuesday, SDF revealed that it had partnered with Coinbase, specifically the startup’s Earn service, to give away $50 worth of XLM to hundreds of thousands of users that are willing to learn about the protocol.",

Indeed, Bakkt, the cryptocurrency futures exchange and infrastructure provider that has been backed by the Intercontinental Exchange and Microsoft, is launching its institutional products in the coming weeks. In fact, Bakkt recently revealed it will be launching its Bitcoin custody service on September 6th, which will be followed by the activation of its Bitcoin futures contracts on September 23rd. Cryptocurrency analysts bill the new exchange as one of the “most bullish” institutional events to ever grace the cryptocurrency industry. You see, Bakkt is expected to allow for many of Wall Street’s institutions to make their first allocations towards Bitcoin, having been approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and backed by veterans of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. What’s interesting is that preliminary discussions already indicate there is institutional demand for such a product. Fundstrat Global Advisors analyst Sam Doctor recently wrote on Twitter that at a Bakkt-sponsored event held in July, he felt as though there are a “critical mass” of institutions — everyone from market makers and liquidity providers to traders and hedge funds — ready to adopt Bakkt’s products. That’s not all. In a similar string of news, Coinbase’s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, wrote on Twitter that there is around $200 million to $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies deposited into Coinbase’s coffers each week from “institutional customers”. Novogratz’s call for Bitcoin to continue its push higher comes shortly after he asserted that the cryptocurrency market would enter a short period of consolidation, which he claimed would see BTC trade in a range around $8,500 to $14,000. While he didn’t mention a specific price target in this new interview, he told Bloomberg earlier that he expects for Bitcoin to shoot to $20,000 by “the middle or the end of the fourth quarter [of 2019].” While Novogratz is expecting for Bitcoin to continue on its merry way, he asserted in the same interview that cryptocurrency technologies are unlikely to impact the lives of mom and pop investors in the short run, claiming that this industry still needs another half-decade to impact society. He elaborated: Backing his point, he looked to Peloton Interactive, a home exercise startup that went live after years in development and took Wall Street by storm. Indeed, as of the time of writing, few cryptocurrencies actually have bonafide use cases. But, momentum in the development side of the industry is starting to trend higher once again. And with applications for this technologies comes adoption, and potential rallies in the prices of digital assets too. As Novogratz put it, “this is not a backwater experiment anymore, this is part of the financial infrastructure”.",

        "passage": "Waltonchain has just announced their new initiative called WTC-Food. The goal of the system is to provide origin and destination tracking for food products. In an explainer video released by the group, the platform is especially targeted at countries like China that lack robust food tracking systems. As a developing country with more than 1 billion mouths to feed, China has a serious problem on its hands. Specifically, the country has been rocked by food scandal after food scandal, the likes of which would leave the average persons stomach churning in disgust.  Read also: Beginners Guide to Waltonchain How bad are they? Here’s a few. A number of meat sellers were caught substituting mutton for rat meat. Fakes of well-known seasoning brands were discovered on grocery store shelves that contained hazardous industrial chemicals that can cause cancer and other serious and immediate health effects. And of course, there was the infamous melamine scandal where a major dairy company added the industrial chemical known as melamine in order to give it the appearance of a higher protein content. The fallout of that particular scandal is still being felt today, with most parents refusing to buy domestic dairy products of any kind for fear that they will once again contain industrial chemicals. This has led to worldwide infant formula shortages due to gray market exporting and hoarding. If someone buys an apple off the grocery store shelf in the United States, there’s usually enough information available so that the apple can be tracked all the way back to the farm it was picked from. This is important because if something were to be wrong with that apple and a recall needed to be issued, then this information will allow authorities to act in a much faster and more effective manner. In China, however, a system like this simply does not exist. Food seems to be collected a farm, and then shuffled through a mysterious process where it changes hands dozens or more times and then appears on a store shelf somewhere else with no clear indication of how it got there. Not only is this an issue for normal concerns like E. coli outbreaks, but China has a long history of intentional food tampering and counterfeiting for profit as was seen in the melamine scandal. The idea posed by Waltonchain, a China-based project, is to use the Waltonchain blockchain to create a system where food can be tracked from its source to its final destination with checks made at each stop.  If WTC-Food works as advertised, it could prove to be a revolution in food safety not only for China, but for anywhere in the world where ensuring food safety is less than easy. Even if a single apple makes 15 stops between the farm and the grocery store, and is bought, sold, and traded just as many times, hypothetically a blockchain-based tracking system could still follow it. A system like this could also enforce compliance. This is because if you are a middleman in the food chain, you would not want to buy food from another middleman that did not participate in the blockchain. Doing so would cause a gap to appear in the food tracking history. This gap could prove to be unacceptable once more major retailers are in on the program. A simple automated system could check to see if a particular food product has an unbroken supply chain or not, and they could choose to reject items which do not have a clear history. This, in turn, would cost money for the middlemen that chose not to participate. While in theory the WTC-Food program sounds like it could change a lot of lives for the better, there are still a few things we don’t know about it just yet. Generally speaking, Chinese law states that information systems must be subject to government monitoring and censorship. For example, each email provider in China must be registered and provide a backdoor for authorities to get full access to any data they want at any time. With this in mind, we don’t know if the government will ask for similar access to the data, or if they will have some ability to alter or censor records. This is all unexplored territory, but what if an outbreak of a minor illness appears in the food chain and the government wants to keep it under wraps? Will they step in and alter records so as not to cause a public outcry? And from a technological perspective, will the Waltonchain blockchain allow for such modifications to be made, or is its blockchain completely immutable? And if it is immutable, how can it comply with censorship laws? Our fingers are crossed in hopes that the government would see the benefits of securing its food supply system instead of trying to put social order in a position above food safety.

        "passage": "In spite of its youth, Binance, a Malta-registered crypto exchange, has rapidly established itself as one at the industry’s finest multi-faceted startups. Case in point, according to statements made by Binance’s chief executive, industry golden child Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the flagship exchange sports ten million users. While this is a jaw-dropping accomplishment in and of itself, the company unveiled plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) in 2018, as CZ touted the merits of non-intermediated transactions.  Little was known about the project until August 2018, when Zhao released a “casual, rough, and pre-alpha” sneak peek of the platform, which had no graphical user interface (GUI) to speak of at the time. Since that fateful date in August, the Chinese technology entrepreneur has kept the pedal to the metal, releasing a stream of videos, pictures, and statements about this nascent facet of Binance’s operations. This came to a head earlier this week, as CZ took to his Twitter page, which has command of the eyes and ears of 275,000 strong, to claim that as Lunar New Year celebrations have occurred, the Binance DEX team “continue to BUIDL.” Hinting that the release of the platform is near, Zhao added that not only was a testnet of Binance Chain — the DEX’s home field, so to speak — pushed to select partners, but integration with Ledger Nano hardware wallets is right around the corner. Released in tandem with this comment was an image of the yet-to-be-released Binance Block Explorer, clad in the defined, well-recognized, and yellow-tinted design that has become the upstart’s calling card.  Zhao went on to divulge more about his latest venture in a Q&A livestream. He explained that Binance Chain will utilize the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, while BNB will act as the network’s gas, just as ETH is for Ethereum. Binance’s fervent leader even quipped that due to the barebones nature of Binance Chain —  lack of a virtual machine means no smart contracts — the network should be able to generate one-second blocks, each of which pertains to “a couple thousand” transactions. Although Vitalik Buterin would argue that such high data throughput is bull, CZ seems adamant that his brainchild should be able to support the brunt of the transactional demand of tens of thousands of clamoring crypto consumers. In closing, doing his best to remain nebulous, Zhao noted that the DEX’s beta iteration will launch in the next “couple of weeks,” but was wary to divulge the planned release date for the final product. News regarding the DEX comes just after the company made a handful of announcements in recent weeks. Along with launching a crypto-to-fiat exchange in Jersey, which was met with copious levels of demand from European citizens, Binance secured a partnership with Simplex, allowing consumers to purchase cryptocurrencies through credit and debit cards. The industry upstart also partnered with Tron to host the ICO of BitTorrent token, a project based on the world-renowned torrenting ecosystem that shares its name. Binance’s incessant strides in the right direction have even caught the attention of Erik Voorhees, deemed “Bitcoin’s last gunslinger” by Forbes. In a recent tweet, the anti-establishment advocate, who is behind the ShapeShift Exchange, CoinCap, and KeepKey ventures, remarked that he’s “impressed and inspired” by the “incredible success” that Binance has achieved in recent memory. Voorhees went on to extoll Zhao, even remarking that he’s been keeping an ear to the ground, especially as the former OkCoin executive has scaled the rungs of the crypto world.  Binance may just be a mere fledgling in Bitcoin’s relatively long history. But with this statement at the forefront, many would argue that the company will continue to outshine its rivals, especially due to its ability to stay afloat in brutal, bone-crushing market downturns. The fact that BNB, the upstart’s in-house token, has surged to the upper echelons of the digital asset space only accentuates this theme. According to Blockonomi’s market analytics tool, BNB, soon to be issued on Binance’s very own blockchain, is now the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.",

        "passage": "If you were one of the world’s most influential companies and you wanted to introduce a cryptocurrency aimed at global domination in the digital payments arena … you might just name it GlobalCoin. That’s what social media titan Facebook has gone and done according to a May 24th report out of the BBC that has considerably advanced the amount of publicly known information around the company’s previously shrouded “Project Libra” crypto project.  For starters, it’s been revealed that Facebook has dubbed the token GlobalCoin in their in-house conversations. Whether that name will stick as the final one for the crypto remains to be seen, but it’s a possibility until the company announces otherwise. Moreover, it’s now known that Facebook is aiming to start GlobalCoin’s journey by launching it for users in approximately 12 countries at some point in the first quarter of 2020. That seemingly marks an expansion, insofar as the very earliest reporting around Facebook’s cryptocurrency project said it was being aimed for an initial pilot in India among WhatsApp users there. Another new revelation comes in the forms of who Facebook’s leadership has been reaching out to regarding the project. It was revealed earlier this month that the social media powerhouse had reached out to card titans Visa and Mastercard for potential support of the cryptocurrency. Courtesy of the new BBC report, we now also know that Facebook has also reached out to payments powerhouse Western Union seeking to help users interact with the coin with ease. Other stakeholders Facebook has since chatted with? One of the world’s most influential bankers, Bank of England’s Mark Carney, and one of the world’s most influential financial bodies, the U.S. Treasury. Those conversations respectively dealt with the possibilities of the coin and relevant regulatory matters. Notably, Facebook has apparently been designing GlobalCoin as a basketcoin — a token that is similar to a stablecoin, i.e. it mitigates price volatility concerns, but it works by being pegged to multiple assets instead of just one. There’s no word for now on what GlobalCoin’s multiple underpinning assets could be. Back in April, New York Times correspondent Nathaniel Popper noted that Facebook appeared to be seeking $1 billion USD in venture funding as collateral to back the basketcoin. Per Popper’s sources, Facebook’s leadership thought reaching out for outside funding was the best way to present the token going forward. As the NYT journalist said last month: Earlier this year, it was also reported that the social media company had already started reaching out to cryptocurrency exchanges about listing GlobalCoin, which is set to undergo its final tests in 2019. As Facebook’s GlobalCoin puts the company on course to compete with mainstream financial institutions like banks, the effort’s called for some further organizational configuring. That’s why Facebook registered Libra Networks, a subsidiary firm that will focus on fintech and blockchain solutions, in Switzerland this May. The entity will run the gamut when it comes to the kinds of services it will provide, as the firm’s registration said it will have an operational focus on “investing, payments, financing, identity management, analytics, big data, blockchain and other technologies.” Of course, when you’re an enterprise as sprawling and as pivotal as Facebook, you’ll always need to have your ducks in a row — particularly when U.S. congressman come calling. U.S. senators sent the company a letter on May 9th demanding answers on how it would approach privacy issues around its new cryptocurrency venture.",

        "passage": "While the Ethereum ecosystem is still fledgling, one common complaint against its decentralized apps, or dapps, is that they’ve proven to be unfamiliar to mainstream users accustomed to regular apps not underpinned by blockchain tech. Unveiled on August 6th, the new Gas Station Network (GSN) aims to cut out complexity from dapps in becoming the “ultimate Ethereum onboarding solution.” How? The new network is an open-source solution designed to help dapps become “indistinguishable from your favorite Web 2.0 apps.” This figurative sleight of hand occurs as dapps that leverage GSN “can now assume the transaction costs of their users” according to a given project’s particular customer acquisition costs (CAC).  This dynamic makes it so that dapp users don’t have to deal with gas fees for transactions because a GSN-based dapp covers these costs right out of the gate. Of course, such a system is contingent on a dapp being able to sustainably afford these costs.  “GSN is not only a must for onboarding, but it is also the key that unlocks new and disruptive business models within the blockchain paradigm,” wrote Ramon Recuero, who formally revealed the network in a Medium post. The network was created through collaborations involving several Ethereum ecosystem stakeholders, such as digital asset security play TabooKey, the dapp DAO MetaCartel, and the OpenZeppelin project. Zooming in, the GSN relies on decentralized relayers — which can be run permissionlessly — to execute transactions. As Recuero explained: The advantages of this system, which now has a live beta on the Rinkeby testnet, is that through it users should no longer have to go through confusing, multi-step onboarding processes or deal directly with address keys. Another pain point native to transparent blockchain cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether is that, if you use addresses and associate them with public activity without resorting to privacy techniques, then anyone with an internet connection and the know-how to review a block explorer can audit your financial history. Consider how some Ethereum dapps and DAOs require public attestations on platforms like Twitter. In the past, to make such verifications with privacy, users would have to turn to or spin up an address they haven’t used in the past. However, many people would surely prefer to have a single consolidated address they could use for all things Ethereum without revealing the entirety of their on-chain activity. That’s where experimental privacy solutions like the Tornado mixer come in.  Tornado, which leverages zk-SNARKS privacy tech to obscure participants’ activity, was first unveiled in late July as a beta on the Kovan testnet. This week, Tornado was released on the Ethereum mainnet. The mixer has yet to be audited and should still be considered experimental, so use it at your own risk until further notice. Still, the project’s advancement comes as many in stakeholders in the Ethereum community have been grappling with how to bring better privacy to their blockchain. For example, Tornado’s testnet beta arrived not long after developer Kendrick Tan released his Heiswap mixer on the Ropsten testnet. Tan built Heiswap according to the minimal design specification that Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin outlined for a mixer back in the spring. These mixers are still early on in their lifespans, but they represent the possibility of Ethereum becoming increasingly private to use.",

        "passage": "With a growing influx of optimism, hype, and the next wave of newcomers in the cryptoeconomy, markets around cryptocurrencies are heating up. On Friday, the bitcoin price ended the week by bursting through $10,000 USD, rising by around $700 USD intraday according to Messari as it settled around $10,150 for the evening. BTC has since gone on to reach a high of $10,800, just $200 short of our Analyst, Nikola Lazic’s prediction yesterday. Notably, the June 21st spike has powered BTC to its best price so far in 2019, putting “digital gold” up 60 percent since this point last year. The genesis cryptocurrency is now up 156 percent over the last three months and up a whopping 1,593 percent over the last five years. Above $10,000, bitcoin is approximately halfway to its December 2017 all-time price high of $20,000.  The acute rally is, of course, only the latest nail in the coffin against naysayers’ arguments that bitcoin would descend into obscurity or even worthlessness after the 2018 cryptoeconomy bear market reared its head. Likely driving the uptrend is Libra, the cryptocurrency that social media giant Facebook formally announced earlier this week. As debate has exploded around Libra in both crypto and mainstream circles, Bitcoin has naturally been brought to the fore as the biggest blockchain with the biggest native cryptocurrency. There are those, like Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, who think FOMO — “fear on missing out” purchases — will boost the bitcoin price up to $15,000 in short order if buy pressure can keep bitcoin past the $10,000 mark decisively in the coming days.  That’s a very optimistic projection, to be sure, but such rapid movement wouldn’t be unprecedented. When bitcoin first hit $10,000 in November 2017, it took less than two weeks for FOMO to nudge the cryptocurrency’s price past $15,000. There’s no telling if that same trajectory will play itself out once more in 2019, but it’s certainly possible with the latest Bitcoin halvening now just months away and the realized capitalization of BTC recently suggesting a bull run was in its early stages.  In any case, Bitcoin has been the beneficiary of several intriguing 2019 headlines. So far this year, Microsoft has announced work on a decentralized identity (DID) tool that will be underpinned by Bitcoin, while mesh networkers GoTenna have spun off a subsidiary to actualize decentralized comms powered by bitcoin micropayments. On the enterprise front, forthcoming cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt — which is owned by New York Stock Exchange owner-operators ICE — is preparing to test its much-hyped bitcoin futures product this July. As for CME Group, their bitcoin futures offering set new records in May. Zooming out, the technical horizon seems to be coming together for Bitcoin too, as its proposed second-layer scaling, the Lightning Network, is maturing all the while. Ether, the figurative fuel of the Ethereum network, also spiked on Friday to its highest price yet this year. The ether (ETH) price spiked more than 10 percent on the day, pushing the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap up as high as $305, where its price hovered for a while. That still puts ether down 39 percent since this time last year and down 79 percent from its all-time high ($1,431), though the crypto is up 117 percent over the last quarter. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has been enjoying plenty of positive headlines as of late. For example, Cloud networking powerhouse Cloudfare just created its own Ethereum Gateway, only days after the Google Cloud team showed how Ethereum could be used to make hybrid “blockchain-cloud” apps. In the mean time, major firms like JP Morgan and EY are building out Ethereum tools. The smart contract platform is on the verge of evolving to its next stage, too. Ethereum’s builders are eyeing January 3rd, 2020, as a target date for launching the ETH 2.0 genesis block.",

        "passage": "For some reason or another, crypto assets and blockchain technologies have struck a chord with gamers — video gamers. Thus, it should come as no surprise that startups are trying to merge the two worlds, doing their best to blend gaming and this budding technology. The movement to “tokenize” and “blockchainify” this form of entertainment moved one step closer. Revealed Wednesday, Blockchain-centric studio Horizon Games has secured $3.75 million in funding from a series of cryptocurrency investors, including the venture fund spearheaded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.  Joining Ohanian’s Initialized Capital in the startup’s seed investment round was Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Inovia Capital, and more. It is important to note that the round closed last year, but was just announced now. If you were born in the western world within the last three or four decades, you likely played the “Pokemon” card game as a grade-school kid. Oddly enough, card games have stuck around. Horizon Games is looking to capitalize on this trend with its “Skyweaver” project, which has been dubbed by the company as a “Trading Card Game from Another Dimension.” Speaking to CoinDesk, Horizon’s chief executive, Peter Kieltyka, noted that with these funds and his team, he intends to build out a blockchain product that “his friends could use” and can potentially compete with digital card games such as “Hearthstone”, which has garnered dozens of millions of users across the globe. Like “Hearthstone”, “Skyweaver” is a game in which gamers can collect cards, create decks, and battle other players with said decks for rewards and digital game. The apparent and relevant difference is that this Ethereum-based project uses blockchain assets as its card management system, rather than centralized databases. More specifically, game’s collectible cards are run via contracts based on the newfangled ERC-1155, which is a token standard built by Enjin for mostly gaming purposes. As it stands, the Ethereum card game is currently in early access phase, but Horizon intends to open the game to the public by year-end. Horizon is the latest of pro-crypto investment made by Initialized Capital. It joins Coinbase, CoinTracker (a Bitcoin tax startup), DDEX (a decentralized exchange), Coinbundle (a cryptocurrency investment startup), and the well-known PolyChain Capital as Ohanian & Co’s crypto plays.  The news regarding this crypto gaming funding round comes as Ubisoft, a video game developer behind Rainbow Six, Far Cry, Just Dance, and other classics, has been revealed to have a “dedicated team” for blockchain applications in gaming. Citing sources familiar with the matter, French paper Les Echos stated that the Ubisoft-backed consortium is on the verge of launching its first blockchain use case. The purported idea is to make items, like digital cosmetics or weapons, accessible through a blockchain system. No specific game titles were mentioned, but it’s presumed that the Ubisoft team intends to facilitate cross-game item transfers. Ubisoft purportedly has plans to use the Ethereum blockchain for this program. Over in America, Epic Games, the company that is behind Fortnite, has partnered with a blockchain game distribution firm called The Abyss. The partnership between the Fortnite behemoth and the upstart competitor to Steam, a gaming community and video game distribution platform, will allow for Abyss users to access the Unreal Developers Networks. All these efforts are important because as Brian Mehler of EOS VC explained to me in a recent interview:",

        "passage": "While the vision held by many involved in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain is an altruistic world of fewer bad actors, the digital asset market is seemingly plagued with shortcomings. In fact, countless reports have revealed that cryptocurrency trading venues and certain projects are far from infallible, citing concerns of widespread data manipulation (wash trading, etc.) to play at investors’ heartstrings. But CoinMarketCap, the most-visited data provider (and webpage for that matter) in this embryonic industry, is looking to change this with a new initiative.  Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), as the venture has been dubbed by CoinMarketCap, is a consortium of industry companies seeking to promote “greater transparency, accountability, and disclosure” from all firms in the space. In a statement, issued on the day of the site’s sixth birthday, the company revealed that it intends to gather more data points to empower its users to make “more informed decisions,” and to give projects a platform to differentiate themselves from the often non-transparent pack through “enhanced discourses.” It was further explained: Joining CoinMarketCap at launch will be a handful of exchange partners, namely Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, and Bitfinex. More partners are expected to join DATA with time. According to the site, partners will be responsible for suggesting updates to DATA’s transparency policy, evaluating the state of cryptocurrency data, funding transparency initiatives, and harmonizing exchange API standards through CoinMarketCap. DATA’s first order of business is to mandate “all exchanges” listed on its data aggregator to broaden the flow of information by providing live trading and order book data, specifically in a bid to ensure liquidity, order book depth, bid/ask spreads, and “other meaningful measures” are as accurate as possible. Those that do not provide such data will be shunned by CoinMarketCap. If this goes well, DATA intends to then provide CoinMarketCap with “enhanced data and metrics,” like wallet information, historical trade data, team information, develop activity, and so on and so forth, for coins and exchanges. All this comes presumably in response to a report from Bitwise Asset Management, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency-focused investment services firm, that revealed that 95% of all BTC trading activity is decidedly false “and/or non-economic in nature.” As Blockonomi reported, the company noted that “suspicious exchanges” such as the little-known CoinBene, utilizes wash trading techniques like “trade printing” and “monotonic” automatic purchases and sales, to falsely boost their rank on CoinMarketCap. Some might be left asking: if wash trading and similar devious techniques don’t affect prices, why does the cryptocurrency market need ‘clean’ data? Aside from protecting investors and companies from dealing with the wrong exchanges or projects, Hunter Horsley of Bitwise has stated that spotless data vectors may give the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a reason to finally approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). He explains in the end, what truly matters for the SEC is a fleshed-out comprehension of this ecosystem’s ins and outs, not a confirmation that all Bitcoin exchanges, investors, and other players are infallible. And as Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s head of research, recently opined, the discrediting of false volumes show that Bitcoin markets are surprisingly efficient. In fact, Hougan explains that if you are to only take legitimate trading activity into account, Bitcoin’s market looks a lot more like that of gold and other commodities — a healthy sign.",

        "passage": "The state of the Bitcoin network and its associated cryptocurrency? Strong and getting stronger, it would seem. On July 9th, cryptoverse stakeholders watched as it became harder than ever before to mine on the genesis blockchain, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rate having spiked to over 9 trillion hashes per second (T) for the first time during the day’s early hours.  The development comes amid that rate uptrending since the beginning of the year — the waning weeks of last year’s cryptoeconomy bear market saw Bitcoin’s mining difficulty sink as low as 5 T. The rate’s all-time high in 2018 had been around 7.5 T, a former peak that was crossed again on May 30th, 2019. The ascension has continued to date, with the difficulty of winning bitcoin mining rewards once more reaching unprecedented heights as of this week. Moreover, the rate’s climb is expected to continue. As of Tuesday, bitcoin mining pool BTC.com has projected BTC mining difficulty will hit over 10.3 T later this month. If that projection were to actualize, the difficulty rate — which self-adjusts approximately every two weeks, namely after lots of 2,016 blocks — would have spiked by more than 14 percent from its current position. To be sure, the growth indicates that new miners are joining the network in droves, as mining difficulty grows in kind as more miners come online. That dynamic matches with comments made last month by Steven Mosher, marketing and sales lead with mining company Canaan Creative. At the time, Mosher noted his company had seen an acute explosion of demand for mining hardware that was then outpacing supply. “It looks like a return to the 2017 Q3 [and] Q4 conditions, where demand was three times the supply,” he said. For example, plenty of ASIC hardware will be needed by miner startup Plouton Mining, which announced plans in June to open up a 50 acre solar-powered bitcoin mining site in the California desert. In the summer of 2017, the BTC dominance rate — the bitcoin market cap’s share of the entire cryptoeconomy’s market capitalization — plummeted to the unprecedented low of 39 percent. At the time, many thought the prospects of the top altcoins had never seemed higher. But in the wake of the 2018 bear market, it’s been bitcoin that has come out enjoying renewed dominance, with the BTC dominance rate now at 63 percent — the highest it’s been since April 2017 before that year’s bull run ripped into gear. That reality has reinforced the belief held by some in the space that after the 2017 cryptoverse bubble many token projects would never recover. In other words, bitcoin has remained king of the hill as smaller projects have waned. The renewed optimism around the OG cryptocurrency has been reflected in its price as of late. Hovering around $12,500 at press time, bitcoin is now up 88 percent on the year, up 139 percent over the last three months, and up 1,928 percent over the last five years. It’s this performance record — one that’s been uncorrelated with traditional markets and more impressive than the recent performance of safe haven assets — that have more people saying bitcoin is a proper safe haven asset itself. So what happens next? Steadily increasing amounts of institutional involvement would be a fair guess. CME Group’s bitcoin futures contracts have seen impressive and growing volume lately, and Bakkt — the long-waited crypto exchange being backed by the owner-operators of the NYSE — will begin trialing its own bitcoin futures product this month. Such increased institutional involvement could serve to lend to Bitcoin’s mining difficulty and dominance rate for the foreseeable future. Alas, its mainstream legitimization as a commodity could end up making Bitcoin that much more dominant.",

        "passage": "The CEO of Autodesk has described some of the most significant issues being faced in the construction industry, and he reiterated his belief that blockchain technology holds the solution to many of these issues, The Australian Financial Review reports. The construction sector is one that has been riddled with cases of corruption in recent years. The increased embezzlement of funds, as well as a desire for people to work without necessarily having their activities- or transactions- tracked, have caused constant friction between players in the industry. However, for Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost, the application of blockchain technology and its implementation in the sector can curb these corrupt practices and usher in an era of accountability and transparency.  Autodesk is one of the largest producers of design software, and the company has been serving the construction, engineering and architectural industries or years. Speaking at the 2018 Autodesk University event in Las Vegas, Anagnost addressed the reason why Autodesk has yet to consider the integration of blockchain into its Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Collection. He said his company had considered it but they “don’t have a point of view” that is known to the public. The AEC Suite, which consists of some of Autodesk’s flagship products (including Revit and AutoCAD) has gone through various phases of development over the years, and it has been responsible for helping to improve data and project information dissemination between collaborators on projects via cloud services. The products under the AEC suite have seen increased adoption due to their practical nature and ease of application. For Anagnost, the next step will involve the use of blockchain technology to develop the culture of trust and transparency that the construction industry is in need of. “What is blockchain good at? It’s a distributed, trusted ledger that cannot be altered and allows traceability and accountability. A technology like that in an environment like construction where various people involved in the process don’t trust each other is going to find some kind of application.” The construction industry has also been rife with issues of embezzlement. “When people are paying hundreds of millions of dollars on large projects, something is always happening somewhere that isn’t quite right. There’s always someone bleeding off resources or money in some inappropriate way,” Anagnost explained. Based on some of his on-site experiences with construction workers, Anagnost said that there is much favoritism going on, and transparency is disrupted when familiarity is allowed to get in the way of work. With the use of blockchain technology, construction processes related to logging and quality control can be optimized. Anagnost believes that blockchain’s greatest value to the construction industry is its ability to deliver a greater degree of trust and traceability, especially in an ecosystem where trust is a scarce trait. Smart contracts have been particularly touted as an integral part of bringing some form of transparency to the management of construction projects. Suppliers can directly request their payment based on the services or goods provided, which will reduce the need for intermediaries (who have been known to cause delays and lapses in transaction handling). Anagnost also mentioned that his company is currently working on a form of non-blockchain digital escrow services, which can also help to improve the development of trust in the sector.",

        "passage": "Litecoin is currently enjoying a significant price gain, up by more than twelve percent over the last 24 hours as the rest of the cryptocurrency market remains relatively stagnant but still in the green. The popular altcoin is now ranked 4th according to CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization north of $2.2 billion.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Litecoin has gained more than 12 percent in the last 24 hours. As at press time, LTC leads the top altcoins based on price gains over the previous 24-hour trading period. Currently, at $36 and counting, LTC is at its highest price level in more than three weeks. The 4th-ranked cryptocurrency is closing in on its 2019 high of $40. Litecoin is still miles away from its all-time high of $362 set in mid-December 2017.  Like most of the cryptocurrency market, LTC suffered massive losses during the 2018 bear market. The altcoin created by ex-Google Engineer, Charlie Lee, slid more than 90 percent as cryptocurrency prices tanked. Concerning the current price gain, it appears the recently announced partnership between the Litecoin Foundation and Beam is responsible. With this in mind, the price rally could be short-lived. In a blog post published by Beam on Thursday (February 7, 2019), the company revealed that it was in discussions with the Litecoin Foundation over a possible implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol on the Litecoin blockchain. An excerpt from the post reads:  With these ongoing discussions, it appears Litecoin is preparing to explore the introduction of privacy features. Using extension blocks running Mimblewimble implementation, LTC users will be able to make use of privacy features not originally part of the Litecoin operating construct. This partnership with Beam to introduce privacy features on Litecoin is coming at a time of significant debate over the overall usefulness of LTC. The appears to be a growing sentiment in some quarters that the emergence of Lightning Network and other off-chain Bitcoin protocol layers effectively render all “Bitcoin-like” altcoins obsolete. In times past, the core of the argument for LTC has been that Bitcoin will inevitably approach a point when the network supersaturated, vastly reducing transaction throughput efficiency. Thus, a lightweight network like LTC will find greater adoption, especially for microtransactions. However, the introduction of SegWit and the continued expansion of Lighting Network functionality severely impacts the validity of these claims. By pivoting to the privacy arena, LTC might be able to carve another niche for itself in the emerging cryptocurrency landscape. LTC’s current surge comes on a day of slight positive price gains for the cryptocurrency market at large. The top ten coins are all currently in the green based on 24-hour price performance as is the majority of the other cryptos in the top-100 ranking. Bitcoin gained $20 at the start of the trading day in an unlikely “pump” given recent events and is up by almost one percent since February 7, 2019. Outside the top ten, the likes of HyperCash (HC), Veritaserum (VERI), and Quant (QNT) lead the gainer’s chart with an average 24-hour price increase of 16 percent. On the flip side, Basic Attention Token (BAT) seems to have reached the end of its mini-rally on account of the recent Coinbase announcement. BAT is down by more than three percent, with Bytecoin (BCN) and THETA (THETA) among the other top losers for the day.",

        "passage": "The cryptocurrency derivatives arena just got its next big contender with the arrival of ErisX, which announced the opening of its crypto spot markets platform on April 30th. The Chicago-based exchange, which boasts major financial backers in mainstream heavyweights like TD Ameritrade and Cboe Global Markets Inc., was first created in 2010 to facilitate traditional cash-settled swap futures. The exchange’s leadership decided to pivot to crypto derivatives in late 2017 and announced last fall that their initial spot contracts offerings would be live by the end of Q2 2019 — a timeline the company has now made good on. A spot contract sets a buy or sell order for an asset, in ErisX’s case cryptocurrencies, which is then settled immediately on a specified date.  Commenting on the launch, ErisX chief operating officer Thomas Chippas hailed the crypto spot operations as only the beginning of the company’s coming journey: ErisX had first declared last year that it was looking to launch physically-settled crypto futures by the end of 2019. The exchange confirmed in their latest announcement that, if greenlighted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), those plans were still on and would entail the marketplace building out both a “regulated futures exchange and [a] clearinghouse.” Of course, ErisX would like to keep to their planned timeline, but the CFTC will accordingly want to be fully confident in the exchange’s operations before granting the requisite approvals. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Commission had yet to approve Bakkt’s own plans for physically-settled bitcoin futures over concerns with the forthcoming exchange’s custody plans. That reality apparently led to Bakkt’s powerhouse backers, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., acquiring crypto custodians Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC). So whether ErisX’s crypto futures will also be temporarily held up by the CFTC remains to be seen. But what is clear is that some major finance players have long been keen on the platform’s product arrivals. When TD Ameritrade first declared their investment into ErisX in 2018, the firm’s futures and foreign exchange managing director J.B. Mackenzie suggested the upstart exchange could eventually offer products like litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH) futures. He said: Amid its crypto spot market opening, the fledgling crypto derivatives platform also announced it had concluded its latest fundraising round, the third in its Series B so far. Participants in the current round included previous ErisX backers like Cboe, Nasdaq Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Ethereum venture capital studio ConsenSys. New investors included Flow Traders and New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG). As part of the deal, NYDIG chief financial and chief operating officer Rob Flatley has joined the ErisX Board of Directors. On the news, Flatley said: So, while ErisX still has a ways to go before it can achieve dominance in its market, the exchange and its supporters are angling to make such dominance closer to a guarantee than a bet.",

        "passage": "Despite positive expectations and enthusiasm on the benefits of the blockchain technology to companies, its integration has proven difficult. According to the research released by Greenwich Associates, the collated data and responses from executives from companies undergoing adoption of the distributed ledger technologies (DLT), has revealed that the process has been harder than expected. The study from Greenwich includes responses from various industries like banks, consultancy firms, technology vendors, dedicated blockchain companies, exchanges, and more.  The report identified various consistent and collective technical challenges that make the adoption of blockchain solutions so difficult. These include issues such as scalability, hardware security concerns, transaction confidentiality, and the handling of the payment component of the transactions. When the issue of scalability was raised, 42% responded identified it as a major problem, 30% called it a minor issue, while 19% didn’t encounter any challenge at all. Seven percent of the chief executives of the companies, however, view the issue of scalability as a significant problem. Author of the report and vice president at Greenwich Associates’, Richard Johnson, said the apparent discrepancy between scalability as an issue in blockchain companies and non-blockchain companies, could be as a result of a number of factors. Such problems could be “due to optimism on behalf of the blockchain companies and their technology,” or because “it represents the fact that a lot of the testing they have done has been in more of a demo environment. When you start connecting with the real world, that introduces latency and slows things down.” The report also revealed that a large number of the firms surveyed were yet to implement DLT transactions solutions, as those in production were still having issues with the slow transaction speed. 2% of the respondents have, however, gone over 15,000 transactions per seconds, a relatively high level of throughput. Blockchain, also referred to as distributed ledger technology came into the financial market scene a few years ago, due to its potential to correct some real-world issues faced in the financial markets. Such issues include a reduction in settlement time, operational costs and streamlining business processes. Companies have millions of dollars in the technology and the necessary workforce in a bid to apply the DLT to their business operation. However, Johnson remains optimistic about the potential and the future of the DLT, even though the ratio of those who have successfully implemented it is still quite small. “We’re beginning to see firms figure out how to get the blockchain to run fast and do a lot of transactions per second, and I think that’s encouraging,” he remarked. Despite being regarded as a “silver bullet” and regardless of the issues it comes with,  blockchain keeps increasing and is widely being adopted by companies to boost efficiency, reduce fraud and waste. The most recent employment of the blockchain technology would be IBM’s Food Trust product, which allows the company to use the technology to track the basis and logistics of perishable food items.  IBM also partnered with PWC, Adel and global legal firm Squire Patton Boggs recently in a bid to fast-track the development and adoption of the distributed ledger technology in the economic and public spheres of the Czech Republic. The main aim of the group is to enhance the Czech economy within the next five years with employment of blockchain, which is believed to be relevant in developing cryptocurrency solutions across sectors. Already in the loop of utilizing this technology includes huge corporations, like Tyson Foods, Nestle, Unilever, and Kroger. In an interview with CNBC, Joe Duran, the CEO of United Capital, talked about how excited he was regarding the future of blockchain technology stating that blockchain “is going to be part of every transaction that occurs in the world,” but adding that “It’s going to take a decade before it’s there.”",

        "passage": "Legendary commission-free stock trading app Robinhood has announced that they have begun offering Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash trading. The announcement was met with praise on Twitter from Robinhood fans, as well as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee.  According to Lee, he has been “bugging them for months” and so it was not a total surprise to him. Robinhood is not the same as other apps like Coinbase or Abra, however, and we will be going over a few of those details shortly.  Robinhood is a stock trading app that caused a big splash when it hit the market a few years ago. Available to citizens and residents of the United States, as well as to citizens of China that have access to an American bank account, Robinhood was revolutionary because it allowed for users to buy and sell stocks for absolutely no commissions in either direction. Not only is the app commission-free, but it also allows for instant deposits, and a form of pseudo-instant settlement. Those who have access to the gold program can sell a stock and then immediately use the proceeds of that sale to buy a different stock without needing to wait several days for settlement. The only time users need to wait for settlement is when they want to withdraw their money.  The system does have anti-day trading measure enabled however, and those who are caught day trading can have their accounts severely restricted. Several months ago, Robinhood shocked the world of crypto by announcing that they would be soon allowing for users to buy and sell within the app, commission and fee-free. It should be noted that Robinhood is not going to be the crypto app of choice for everyone. Instead, it services are tailor-made for a very specific type of crypto investor. Today, the Robinhood app can only be used for buying and selling four cryptocurrencies within the app itself only. This means that users cannot use Robinhood as a cryptocurrency wallet. They cannot make deposits, nor can they withdraw cryptocurrencies from it. Basically speaking, any crypto bought within the app, stays in the app forever. So who is the Robinhood app for? Simply put, it’s for those that want to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in order to make a profit on the price difference. It is not for those that want to buy and hold cryptocurrencies in cold storage, or buy bitcoin and exchange it for altcoins, or invest it into an ICO. Another unfortunate side effect of Robinhood being US-based and complying with all relevant laws is that the app is only allowing cryptocurrency trading in a handful of US states. Specifically, only customers with a registered address in the following states can participate. They are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. So with only 17 states eligible for participation, more than half of the United States is being left out in the cold. And of course, so is the rest of the world. Not surprisingly, New York state is not on this list. This is because New York is infamous for its strict cryptocurrency laws, and they require any business that has dealings with citizens of New York to have a so-called “bit license”. Recently, Square’s Cash App was able to secure this license, but they are one of an even smaller handful of businesses to be lucky enough to get this license. And unfortunately for this author, who is not in one of the lucky 17 states, we are not able to try buying and selling cryptocurrencies on Robinhood firsthand. According to the official Robinhood cryptocurrency section of their website, the company is considering adding the ability to withdraw cryptocurrencies from Robinhood. The company says that while they don’t support withdrawals now, they “plan to do so in the near future.” In regards to making deposits of cryptocurrency, the company claims that they do not allow this because their “primary concern is to prevent money from illegal activity being used for transactions on Robinhood Crypto.” For now though, if you’re lucky enough to live in one of the 17 approved states, and your primary goal is just to buy low and sell high, Robinhood could be a dream come true. And with the addition of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin trading, that dream just got a little bit sweeter. For the rest of us, patience.",

        "passage": "On Wednesday, Mark Yusko, founder, and partner at Morgan Creek Capital Management, made an appearance at CNBC: Fast Money, where he laid out his claim that Bitcoin is a much better investment option than traditional stocks as of this point. Yusko is actually quite popular in the stock industry, particularly for correctly predicting the sell-off in stock that occurred in 2018. In this interview, he expressed his belief that the stock market is already witnessing another bear market, and things could get considerably worse as time goes on. As a result, he went on to endorse Bitcoin (BTC) as a surer investment portfolio at the moment.  Speaking on his conclusion, he added, “I even wear my Bitcoin tie today for you guys. I was on this show back in December when it was $3100, and you said, ‘What do you think?’ I said, ‘Look. We’ve issued the Morgan Creek Digital crypto challenge, we will take Bitcoin over the next 10 years, starting on January 1st, and we will take anybody who wants to take the other side.’ It was a $1 million charity bet, just like the Buffett style bet. We got no takers.” The bet that Yusko was referring to is the “Buffett Bet 2.0,” which was issued by Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, his partner at Morgan Creek Capital, last year. While speaking with CNBC in December, Pompliano announced the challenge, saying that he was willing to wager $1 million on the fact that Morgan Creek’s basket of digital assets would outperform the S&P 500 over ten years, starting from January 1, 2019. He famously invited anyone who was willing to stand on the other side of such a bet, saying that it would most likely be someone bullish on the S&P 500, or who believes that cryptocurrencies are worthless. In the latest interview, Yusko went on to point out that not taking that bet turned out to be the best thing for any would-be takers, as “while BTC is already up over 100 percent this year, the S&P is only up 14 percent.” Yusko’s comments were surely not wrong. BTC held a price of $3,744 as of January 1, while its unit price at press time is pegged at $7,601. That’s an increase of 103 percent (according to data from CoinMarketCap). On the flip side, the S&P 50 closed at 2,510 points on January 1, while the closing value as at May 22 was 2,856, marking a growth rate of 13.8 percent since the turn of the year (per data from the CNBC Index). If you thought about betting against Pomp, you’d be pretty much in the hole already. After pointing out this disparity, Yusko added, “I think going forward from here, even over the next year, over the next 10 years, it’s not going to be close. Bitcoin is a great diversifying asset, it has a very low correlation, it should be in anybody’s portfolio.” Pompliano recently had to come out to make a point about cryptocurrencies. Last Tuesday, he was a guest on CNBC’s Squawk Box, where he engaged in a somewhat heated argument with Kevin O’Leary, chairman of investment firm O’Shares ETFs O’Leary wasted no time in trashing Bitcoin, going as far as calling is “garbage” and “useless.” Despite the noticeable uptick in its prices last week, Bitcoin didn’t seem to impress the investor. He questioned the value of Bitcoin, claiming that it is “basically a digital game” without any intrinsic value. In his defense, Pompliano pointed out that that Bitcoin was going through a bit of a rough start, just as it is with every other disruptive technology in the world. He added that currencies work with a “belief system,” and BTC is functioning as money. “So, for the US dollar, the only reason you and I use it is because we believe it has value. So I give you a dollar, and you give me a good or service in exchange. Bitcoin has value because the two people who exchange it believe it has value. And what we’re seeing is the volume, look at people using it,” he confirmed.",

        "passage": "ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees has criticized a published Wall Street Journal (WSJ) investigative article that purported the crypto exchange was used by criminals to launder money, which he claims are “inaccurate.” According to an official blog post, the CEO of the crypto exchange said the Wall Street Journal report showed a fundamental misinterpretation of how cryptocurrencies work and that the article’s claims were “factually inaccurate and deceptive.”  Explaining further, Voorhees said ShapeShift had been working with the Journal for nearly half a year, yet the article “omitted relevant information” and revealed that “the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of blockchain and our platform in particular.” On Friday, an article published by two reporters at the Wall Street Journal titled “How Dirty Money Disappears into the Black Hole of Cryptocurrency,” concluded that a sum of $88 million was laundered via 46 different exchanges in the space of two years—with ShapeShift being responsible for $9 million of the total amount laundered.  Read: Bitcoin & Money Laundering The preamble of the article stated: The article singled out ShapeShift and inferred that the digital asset platform encourages illegal transaction because the system doesn’t require user information until much recently. However, Voorhees fought back on the claims and argues that if indeed $9 million was laundered through ShapeShift, it would translate to only 0.15 percent of the exchange’s total transaction. Besides, the exchange has “a strong record of complying with law-enforcement requests, providing valuable assistance in over 30 investigations in 13 different countries all over the world.” He also added that users could not launder fiat currencies through the exchange, stating: Voorhees stated that the misinterpretation of how ShapeShift work may have led to some of the Journal’s conclusions. Citing an example of some funds that were transferred via a suspicious transaction to an exchange, which later sent funds to ShapeShift. Here’s what he wrote, Voorhees went on to explain how much transperancy means to the platform. According to him, ShapeShift is one of the most transparent exchanges operating today. Every transaction through the platform is published online, irrespective of the user privacy protections that it has maintained to date. He also stated the Journal leveraged on this information to carry out its investigation, adding that “perhaps the irony is lost on the WSJ, but the WSJ would have been unable to do this kind of investigation with any other crypto exchange because they aren’t transparent in this way.”",

Crypto advocates say these recruitments could be some of the first tricklings toward mainstream adoption for the fledgling technologies.  On March 20th, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey posted a series of tweets in which he announced that a new Square Crypto initiative would be launching and that he was looking to hire a handful of Bitcoin Core or cryptoverse experts to fill out the positions: Square Cash, the company’s payments platform, surged into being the most widely downloaded financial app on the Apple iOS and the Google Play Store in late 2018 after the app began offering bitcoin (BTC) buys and sells to its users earlier in the year. However, per Dorsey, Square Crypto will be a non-commercial and open-source initiative whose resulting releases, whatever they may be, will be offered for free for the benefit and betterment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Likely boding further crypto inroads for both Twitter and Square, Dorsey later added that he was becoming fascinated with, and enthusiastically embracing, the cryptocurrency community: The Square CEO concluded his announcement in noting that interested prospects could reach out via the new Square Crypto Twitter account to apply: A new position has been listed as open on the Facebook Careers page: Lead Commercial Counsel, Blockchain.  Any takers? Image via Facebook Careers As the posting explains, the Menlo Park position would center around contracts for Facebook’s commercial blockchain initiatives: The posting doesn’t come as a surprise. The Silicon Valley social media powerhouse has been ramping up its blockchain activities in recent times, so commercial endeavors may be just around the corner. Back in February, the Facebook blockchain team hired a handful of blockchain engineers from crypto company Chainspace, presumably for the team’s expertise in smart contracts. Later that month, company co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was looking at replacing the Facebook Connect authentication system with some form of distributed, blockchain-based tech. Another major related revelation came through recent reporting that Facebook’s “basketcoin” — a stablecoin pegged to several assets instead of one — was far enough along in its development that the company was already talking to cryptocurrency exchanges to prep for listing the coin. The grand takeaway here is that Facebook’s crypto and blockchain plans are accelerating, and the company is taking serious steps to foster that acceleration. Other major companies may be following suit shortly per Facebook’s rather glaring example.",

        "passage": "Abra – the world’s first and only all-in-one digital wallet and cryptocurrency exchange – has announced its support for Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) bank accounts. European customers can now enable direct wire transfers from assorted European banks to purchase any of Abra’s 28 available cryptocurrencies.  Founded in the year 2014, Abra seeks to provide users with 100 percent privacy and control over their digital finances. The application is non-custodial, which means the wallet’s private keys are never held by anyone other than the actual customer. Abra is completely peer-to-peer and cuts out all middlemen, so customer funds are never touched, managed or even viewed by third parties. Past and present investors in Abra include First Round Capital, Arbor Ventures and RRE Ventures. CEO Billy Barhydt exclaims: Abra wallets were initially funded using both wire and bank transfers in the United States. Customers could also purchase cryptocurrencies using either debit or credit cards. The platform’s integration of SEPA will now give several European Union nations the opportunity to deposit either euros or 50 separate national fiat currencies into their Abra wallets for use towards crypto purchases. Among the countries now privy to this service are Cyprus, Austria, Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany and Italy. Upon transferring fiat currency to their Abra wallets, European customers will see their money instantly transformed into bitcoin, which can then be stored safely and securely in their Abra accounts or traded at any time for one of the platform’s many altcoin offerings. Abra has also announced that it is adding three more cryptocurrencies – Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Tron (TRX) – to its growing trading system. Abra currently allows users to invest in several major tokens such as bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, bitcoin cash and Dogecoin among others. Barhydt states: The cryptocurrency arena in Europe is garnering quite a bit of attention as of late. Bruegel – a Brussels-based think tank – recently stated its belief that Europe can no longer hold out digital currency’s popularity and must move fast to adopt widespread regulation. The organization recently issued a report that acknowledges fear of financial crime such as money laundering and fraud, while also praising cryptocurrencies for their anonymity, low transaction fees and ease of access. Bruegel is now calling upon the European Union to create a full playbook regarding digital assets, so the public can both understand and use them to their full potential. Meanwhile, a summit amongst EU leaders in countries such as France and Germany will occur later this week in Austria’s capital of Vienna. Though full details are not yet clear, officials are slated to discuss further integration of blockchain technology, while developing warning mechanisms for investors regarding the dangers and uncertainties behind crypto. Thus far, state governments in Europe have failed to take legitimate actions regarding cryptocurrency trading, thereby leaving decisions in the hands of local regulators. This has provided strong leeway in Europe’s growing cryptocurrency space by allowing digital asset ventures to pick up and move to less stringent regions before regulators can move.",

        "passage": "Terrorists. Cryptocurrency haters have been using the excuse of terrorists for years now. They argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with privacy features, will inevitably be used to fund terrorism and launder money. Is there any truth to this claim? Are terrorist groups using crypto to fund their operations? According to a report by the nonprofit RAND Corp., the group famous for producing research documents for the US military, terrorists are not generally using crypto. The reason? Crypto just isn’t widely accepted enough.  While crypto bashers love to cite terrorism as a reason for putting a leash on cryptocurrency, there is some degree of truth to this concern. Terrorism is real. These groups need funding in order to bankroll their operations. For instance, the report states that terrorist groups need money to “purchase of weapons, payrolls, supporting attacks, and other operational activities.” Traditionally, terrorists have funded their operations through black-market activities such as making and selling drugs, human trafficking, and a plethora of other deplorable practices. This money then needs to be laundered and moved around the globe securely. This need presents a serious problem. The international banking system has safeguards in place to restrict this type of activity. While there are ways to get around these restrictions, the potential for the nefarious use of cryptocurrency is definitely there. With cryptocurrency offering instantaneous anonymous global transfers of value with no potential for interference from governments or banks, shouldn’t terrorists be flocking to crypto? Apparently, they aren’t. According to the report titled Terrorist Use of Cryptocurrencies released by RAND Corp., cryptocurrencies are simply too undeveloped to be of much use to terrorists. One issue is that cryptocurrencies are still not very widely accepted. This means if a terrorist is sitting on a pile of any given cryptocurrency, it’s not particularly easy to directly spend those coins or tokens for the supplies or services they need. Compared to the iconic briefcase full of cash, an electronic wallet full of crypto is just not as versatile for terrorists. The report describes this issue as follows: A lack of ATMs isn’t the only hurdle, either. The report also stated that: “Generally…the conditions needed to allow terrorist groups to establish themselves and flourish…might make the technological infrastructure needed for cryptocurrencies infeasible.” In other words, limited access to the internet or wallet devices could be a problem. The small size of cryptocurrency markets (in comparison to traditional markets) also hinders the ability of terrorists to hide their activities. According to the report: “Large transactions have impacts on price; demand increases are reflected in publicly visible prices, making the transaction non-anonymous.” Black-market activities can be big business. Terrorist groups can put together millions of dollars from their illicit activities. Such large amounts of money are simply too difficult or nearly impossible to hide on low-volume markets. This is particularly true for smaller privacy cryptocurrencies like Monero, which the RAND report mentions specifically. One obvious concern that can be drawn from the report is that the restrictions facing terrorists today could become moot in the coming years. If cryptocurrencies continue to see greater adoption, then the need to have a direct link to fiat currencies through an exchange may become unnecessary. If terrorists are able to engage in high-volume transactions among each other directly using privacy-centric cryptocurrencies, then their need for money laundering and transmission services will essentially be met. This kind of acceptance will also preclude the need for services like bitcoin ATMs because again a fiat link would be mostly unnecessary. Further, the type of failed states where terrorism flourishes could see greater connectivity to the Internet as technology develops, even if regional infrastructure is mostly nonexistent. For example, mobile wallets connected through satellite connections could easily provide the needed connectivity to conduct cryptocurrency transactions anywhere on the face of the planet, even in the middle of the ocean on top of a dilapidated black-market freighter. The issue of terrorists using cryptocurrency is in some ways a red herring. Any group that is bent on causing violence, fear, and mayhem will likely find a way to do so regardless of convenient monetary tools. Terrorism is still an issue today, despite decades of harsh bank and government imposed controls. Clearly, the terrorists have found ways to fund their goals already. If they adopt crypto en masse, will that make any difference?",

        "passage": "Blockchain, the hugely famous start-up company, not the ledger architecture, is suing a company in US court. They claim that a seemingly abandoned company has created a web-presence that emulated their own, and is on the cusp of launching an ICO. The mostly unregulated nature of the crypto market makes these kinds of issues nearly unavoidable, but it looks like the US court system is beginning to take the crypto world seriously. It is ironic that Blockchain would be targeted by scammers, as they have stated that their goal is to help the crypto community to root-out scams. The potentially crooked company on the other end of the lawsuit is the apparently abandoned “Paymium”, which was thought to be long relegated to Bitcoin history.  Paymium was at the center of a crypto controversy dating back to 2013. The company claimed to the the victim of a hack, wherein numerous clients and creditors lost substantial amounts of their cryptos. Their “Instawallet” service ended up being a full-on debacle, and the company seemingly went out of business after they suspended their claiming service. Fast-forward to last week, when Blockchain filed suit against whoever is at the helm of Paymium in US federal court. For now the details are scant, but a recent move by a New York court could land whoever is running Paymium in some very hot water. A case in New York could be setting some heavy precedents for ICO scammers. The judge in a case being brought against Protostarr ICO decided that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could move legally against potentially fraudulent ICO. Lawyers for Maksim Zaslavskiy had argued that because US securities law is vague, ICOs were outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction. Maksim Zaslavskiy was connected to numerous crypto companies, including RECoin and PlexiCoin ICO. These cases might sound obscure, but they could have widespread consequences. Blockchain is registered in Luxembourg, but they chose to sue Paymium in US courts. The SEC oversees one of the largest financial systems in the world, and if they decide to go after a violator, the US has law enforcement treaties with numerous nations. It appears that the US has decided at a (potentially federal) judicial level that tokens are considered securities, and fall under the jurisdiction of US regulators. The crypto markets have been largely under the collective radar of both law enforcement and regulators since their inception, but that looks like it is changing. Apparently Maksim Zaslavskiy made the specific argument that tokens can’t be considered securities. Now that a New York court has found the contrary to be true, the weight of the precedent is difficult to overstate. It would be fair to assume that if anyone wanted to allege wrongdoing in an ICO, they will be able to do so in New York’s courts. A study prepared by Statis Group that was released earlier this year estimated that more than 80% of the ICOs from 2017 were fraudulent to some degree. Thankfully the money that was raised by ICOs last year wasn’t distributed equally. Of the roughly $12 billion USD that flowed into ICOs in 2017, Statis estimated that more than $1.3 billion USD found its way to ICOs that looked like outright scams. Not that it looks like US courts are allowing tokens to be considered a security for purposes of prosecution, the hunt could be on for an major ICO scam to make an example of. In most cases financial crime isn’t prosecuted with this same vigor as violent crime, but with cryptos, this may not be the case. To be clear, there has been no new law, just a clarification of existing regulations. Because the regulations that are being used to prosecute Maksim Zaslavskiy were in effect last year, fraudulent ICOs have little legal room to maneuver. With all the jilted ICO investors who must be out there, this isn’t great news from the perspective of the dishonest people who thought they could get away with hundreds of millions of dollars without any consequences.",
